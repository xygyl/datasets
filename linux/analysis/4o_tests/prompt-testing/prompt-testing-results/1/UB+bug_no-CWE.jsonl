However, the overlap check `(tmp + newsize) > fdtstart && tmp < fdtend` does not account for all edge cases of memory overlap, particularly when `tmp` and `buf` are very close or partially overlap. This could lead to unintended behavior during the `memmove` operation.", "fix_suggestion": "Ensure a stricter overlap check or use a temporary buffer to avoid any risk of memory corruption during the `memmove` operation."}
