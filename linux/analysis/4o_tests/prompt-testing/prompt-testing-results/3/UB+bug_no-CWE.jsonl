This can lead to incorrect behavior when `vm_wait` is recalculated, as the decrement logic does not properly account for the reset of `current_timeo`. This may cause the loop to behave incorrectly, potentially leading to an infinite loop or premature exit.", "fix_suggestion": "Ensure that the decrement of `vm_wait` and the reset of `current_timeo` are consistent and do not conflict. Consider restructuring the logic to avoid resetting `current_timeo` after it has been used to decrement `vm_wait`."}
