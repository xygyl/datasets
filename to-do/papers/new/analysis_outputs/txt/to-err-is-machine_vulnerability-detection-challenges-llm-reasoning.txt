## 1. What is the point of this paper? What is it trying to explore? What makes it unique?

**Point & Exploration:**

- The paper investigates the ability of state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs), including those pretrained and fine-tuned on code, to detect software vulnerabilities—a complex code reasoning task.
- Specifically, it explores whether advances in model size, data scaling, fine-tuning, and prompt engineering have enabled LLMs to understand code semantics well enough to distinguish buggy (“vulnerable”) code from fixed versions.
- It systematically diagnoses where the reasoning failures occur, through both quantitative experiments and a manual, multi-rater error analysis of model outputs to code examples.

**What makes it unique:**

- It is the first study to systematically test 14 SOTA LLMs across 7 prompting methods on a high-quality benchmark devoted to real-world vulnerabilities.
- Unlike prior work (which often compares models on BLEU scores or summary generation), this paper deeply analyzes *why* and *where* the models fail—categorizing errors at each step of the vulnerability reasoning process (e.g., bounds checking, pointer handling, logic).
- It goes beyond basic zero-shot and few-shot prompting to experiment with tailored prompts, including chain-of-thought (CoT) and static analysis-informed prompts, and quantifies the effect of domain knowledge infusion.
- The authors make their code, data, prompts, and error analysis tool publicly available for replication and further research.

## 4. What are the prompting strategies discussed in this paper?

### a) **Baseline Prompts:**
- **Basic (Zero-shot):** "Is the following function buggy? Please answer Yes or No."
  - Variants: using “vulnerability” instead of “buggy,” placing question in Q/A format, etc.
- **In-Context (n-shot):** Provide example input/response pairs for in-context learning.
  - Example selection: random, semantically similar (embedding-based), contrastive pairs.

### b) **Proposed Advanced Strategies:**

- **Contrastive Prompting:**  
  - In-context examples of both vulnerable and fixed (patched) versions, highlighting subtle differences (contrastive learning).
- **CoT-CVE:**  
  - Provide chain-of-thought style reasoning steps using human-written vulnerability (e.g., CVE) descriptions.
- **CoT-StaticAnalysis:**  
  - Chain-of-thought using reasoning paths generated by an automatic static analyzer (Infer), transformed into stepwise natural language explanations.
- **CoT-Annotations:**  
  - Custom prompt with code annotated (via lightweight static analysis) to flag possible null assignments, null checks, pointer dereferences, etc., and a step-by-step reasoning instruction.
  - Targeted at Null-Pointer Dereference vulnerabilities (case study).

- **Main Paper:** Section 2 ("CAN LLMS EFFECTIVELY DETECT VULNERABILITIES?")
- **Appendix A:** Detailed breakdowns and example templates for each prompting strategy, including variants and data pre-processing for examples.

## 6. What are the results of the prompting strategies and how successful were they?

- **Summary:** None of the strategies, including improved prompts, increasing model size, more training data, or fine-tuning, yielded substantial improvements over random guessing (Balanced Accuracy ≈ 50%).
- **Best Case:** The best models/prompt combinations only reached ~54.5% Balanced Accuracy (StarCoder2).
- **Contrastive prompts** and planned chain-of-thought methods marginally improved certain models (~1-4%), but did not reach practically useful reliability.
- **CoT-Annotations** (domain knowledge) reduced errors in recognizing bounds/NULL checks by up to 70% in some models, but overall accuracy remained limited (~23-67% of such cases still missed), suggesting other logical reasoning bottlenecks persist.
- **Distinguishing vulnerable/fixed versions:** Even GPT-4 failed to tell patched from vulnerable code 67% of the time.
- **Error analysis:** Over half of model responses contained errors in at least one reasoning step (see Table 3 and Figure 3).
- **Model and training scaling:** Expanding data, instruction/adapter fine-tuning, and using code-specialized models produced minimal (often <4%) gains.

---

## 7. Why did one strategy give better results than another?

- **Direct infusion of domain knowledge (e.g., CoT-Annotations) helps with *local* reasoning tasks** (like recognizing a null check or pointer assignment), thus reduces certain types of errors.
- However, **overall improvements are limited** because:
  - Many vulnerabilities require *multi-step causal reasoning* (e.g., values flowing through variables, interaction across statements), where models habitually failed.
  - Even if domain knowledge helps with one sub-reasoning step (e.g., bounds check detected), logical integration (e.g., Is it checked on every path?) still fails.
- **Contrastive prompts** perform slightly better since the model sees minimal code changes leading to label changes, but models often cannot connect these changes to correct underlying semantics.
- **Scaling (data/model size/fine-tuning)** does not help because the models lack access to execution-level data and fail to extract subtle, context-dependent semantics from code (auto-regressive pretraining is text-based).
- The failures point to **fundamental architectural/training limitations**—not simply lack of data or prompting.

## 8. All specifics of the researcher’s prompt strategies

### a) **Basic (Zero-shot) Prompt**
- “I want you to act as a vulnerability detection system.” Plus “Is the following function buggy? Please answer Yes or No.”
- Varied: sometimes specified a bug type list (e.g., CWE-190 integer overflow).

### b) **In-Context (n-shot) Prompt**
- Several annotated input/output pairs provided ahead of the new query.
- Examples chosen by:
  - Random selection
  - Semantic similarity (using CodeBERT embedding similarity)
  - Contrastive pairs: Function pairs only differing by the bug-fix (vulnerable/fixed)

### c) **Contrastive Prompt**
- Both vulnerable and fixed code shown as context.
- Intention: teach the model that subtle code changes can entirely shift the vulnerability outcome.

### d) **CoT-CVE Prompt**
- Example pairs where the in-context response is:
  - Stepwise natural language reasoning, written/adapted from human vulnerability descriptions in `CVE` records.
  - Example snippet: "The function allocates a buffer at line 3. At line 5 the buffer is accessed..."
  - Append: “Therefore, the example is buggy.”

### e) **CoT-StaticAnalysis Prompt**
- In-context reasoning steps extracted from a static analysis tool (Infer) on open-source code (from D2A dataset).
- Bug-triggering code paths translated to descriptive, logical steps.
- Example:  
  1. "A buffer buf of size 10 is allocated at line 1."
  2. "An index i is initialized to [0,100] at line 2."
  3. "i is used to access buf at line 3. This may exceed bounds..."

### f) **CoT-Annotations Prompt** (Section 3.3 & Figure 8)
- *Custom lightweight static analysis* to annotate where in the code pointers get assigned null, where null checks happen, etc.
- Explicit instructions: For each potential null pointer, mark where dereferenced, where checked, and reason step-by-step (see full example in Figure 8).
- Used as a case study for Null-Pointer Dereference vulnerabilities.

### g) **Misc Details**
- Formatted examples as single chat messages (performed best).
- Explored appending 1-10 in-context examples; best result at 6.
- Filtered/selected high-quality in-context examples: not too short/long, relevant to vulnerability types, with clear bug labels.
- For negative (non-vulnerable) examples: Default (basic) response format used.

All prompt templates and data are available in the public data package (Appendix A; [doi link](https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.27368025)).

## In Summary

**The paper demonstrates that even the best LLMs, with sophisticated prompting and extensive training, cannot reliably perform complex, multi-step reasoning over code required for vulnerability detection.** Small, targeted prompt improvements can reduce certain reasoning errors, but fundamental errors persist. This suggests that simply scaling language models is not enough—fundamental advances in code understanding and reasoning are needed.

If you need code snippets, further example prompts, or more fine-grained information about the error taxonomy or prompt construction, let me know!
