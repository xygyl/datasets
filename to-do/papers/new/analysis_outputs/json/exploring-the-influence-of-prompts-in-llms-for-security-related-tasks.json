Here is an organized and detailed breakdown addressing each of your questions about the paper **\"Exploring the Influence of Prompts in LLMs for Security-Related Tasks\"**:\n\n---\n\n## 1. What is the point of the paper? What is it trying to explore? What makes it unique?\n\n**Point and exploration:**  \nThe paper systematically investigates how the construction of prompts—specifically their structure and content—affects the performance of large language models (LLMs) on security-related tasks. While prompt engineering for general tasks has been widely studied, its impact on specialized domains like security (where tasks involve code, natural language, and security-specific terms) is underexplored. The study aims to:\n\n- Identify which types of prompt structures (e.g. zero-shot, one-shot, few-shot) are effective for security tasks.\n- Determine which kinds of prompt content (e.g. role definition, emotional cues, GPT-generated content) enhance LLM performance in these tasks.\n- Explore if combining multiple prompt engineering strategies further improves results.\n\n**Uniqueness:**  \n- First systematic, quantitative comparison of diverse prompt structures and contents for LLMs in security-related contexts.\n- Focuses on three practical, real-world security tasks.\n- Highlights that best-performing prompt strategies vary by task—there’s no \"one-size-fits-all.\"\n- Provides reproducible results and code/datasets.\n\n---\n\n## 2. What dataset did they use?\n\nThey consider three benchmark datasets, each for a specific security-related task:\n\n- **Security Patch Detection (SPD):** [PatchDB](https://github.com/Wayne-Bai/Prompt-Affection) – 12,000 labeled security patches & 24,000 non-security patches from sources like the NVD and GitHub.\n- **Vulnerable Function Detection (VFD):** [Devign](https://github.com/microsoft/Devign) – 48,687 C/C++ functions labeled as vulnerable or not, with data from projects like Linux, QEMU, Wireshark, and FFmpeg.\n- **Stable Patch Classification (SPC):** [PatchNet](https://github.com/hvdang/patchnet), with 82,403 Linux kernel patches labeled as stable or not.\n- **Sampling for experiments:** 2,000 samples per task (1,000 positive and 1,000 negative).\n\n---\n\n## 3. What LLM models were used?\n\n- **GPT-3.5-Turbo** (via the OpenAI API) was used exclusively for all experiments. Chosen for availability, capability, stable API throughput, and cost-effectiveness.\n- Note: No experiments with GPT-4 or open LLMs due to budget, but methodology and code are open-sourced for future research.\n\n---\n\n## 4. What are the prompting strategies discussed in this paper?\n\n### **Prompt Structure (Framework)**\n- **Zero-shot:** Only a task description; no examples.\n- **One-shot:** Task description + one example (either positive or negative class).\n- **Few-shot:** Task description + two examples—can be two positives, two negatives, or one of each (in either order).\n  - *Variants named*: 1-shot-t, 1-shot-f, few-shot-tt, few-shot-ff, few-shot-tf, few-shot-ft.\n\n### **Prompt Content**\nNine types (can be applied to any structure):\n- **Basic:** Plain task description and query.\n- **Role:** Sets a specific role (“You are an AI expert in patch analysis…”).\n- **Act As-User / Act As-System:** Specifies the persona in either the user's or the system’s message (e.g., “Act as security expert…”).\n- **GPT-generated:** Prompt written by GPT-3.5 itself given task description.\n- **Emotion:** Motivational or psychological cues, including:\n    - **Encourage**: Positive reinforcement (“you’re the best...”)\n    - **Threaten**: Negative consequences for failure (“…otherwise you are the worst…”)\n    - **Reward**: Promise of positive reward for good output (“If you do well, you get a tip”)\n    - **Punish**: Threat of punishment for failure (“If badly, you will be fined”).\n\n- **Combined:** Some experiments combine structure and content (e.g., role + GPT-generated).\n\n---\n\n## 5. Where are the prompt strategies explained?\n\n- **Prompt structures:** Section II-B (“Prompt Structure”).\n- **Prompt contents:** Section II-C (“Prompt Content”).\n- **Table I** in Section II-C shows concrete prompt content examples for the SPD task.\n- **Tables II, III, IV** display results for combinations of content and structure for each task.\n- **Section II-D** explains the experimental methodology and performance metrics.\n\n---\n\n## 6. What are the results of the prompting strategies, and how successful or not were they?\n\n**General findings:**\n\n- **Prompt structure and content both substantially affect LLM performance.** The difference between worst- and best-performing strategies for a task can be 13–30% in accuracy.\n- **Task dependence:** The most effective prompt structure/content varies by task.\n\n**Detailed successes:**\n\n- **Security Patch Detection (SPD):**  \n  - **Best structure:** few-shot-ff (two negative examples) yields highest accuracy, recall, and F1.\n  - **Best content:** \"Punish\" content variant yields the best overall performance in most structures; \"GPT-generated\" gives best precision.\n- **Vulnerable Function Detection (VFD):**\n  - Structures make less impact; sometimes zero-shot or one-shot-t is best depending on the metric.\n  - Precision is best with 1-shot-t; recall with 0-shot. Adding more examples may sometimes confuse the LLM.\n- **Stable Patch Classification (SPC):**\n  - Structures: few-shot-ff helps for recall and F1; 1-shot-f helps for precision.\n  - Content: Changing content generally has little effect for this task except for GPT-generated, which often makes things worse.\n\n- **Combining contents:**  \n  - Rarely helps further; only about 10% of cases show improvement when combining, and often combinations perform worse.\n\n**See Tables II-IV for all numeric results.**\n\n---\n\n## 7. Why did one strategy give better results than another?\n\n- **Data bias:** For some tasks (like SPC), the LLM is biased towards the majority (non-security) class, so seeing more negative examples (few-shot-ff) helps it recognize positives.\n- **Task nature:** For VFD, vulnerabilities may be highly diverse, so few demonstrations can’t capture generalizable patterns; here, zero-shot works best.\n- **Prompt content:** Psychological or role-based content can act as \"priming\" for the LLM, nudging it to take tasks more seriously or mimic expert behavior, but the effect depends strongly on task relevance.\n- **Prompt order and class:** The sequence of examples (positive/negative) and class shown can orient the model to pay attention to certain features or biases.\n- **GPT-generated prompts:** Sometimes too verbose or generic, and may introduce unnecessary details that reduce accuracy.\n\n---\n\n## 8. All specifics of the researcher's prompt strategies.\n\n### **Prompt structures:**\n- **Zero-shot:** Just the task description.\n- **1-shot-t:** Task description + one positive-class example.\n- **1-shot-f:** Task description + one negative-class example.\n- **few-shot-tt:** Two positive examples.\n- **few-shot-ff:** Two negative examples.\n- **few-shot-tf/ft:** One positive and one negative, order varied.\n\n### **Prompt contents:**\n- **Basic:** Plain instruction.\n- **Role:** \"You are Frederick, an AI expert in patch analysis. Your task is to decide whether...\"\n- **Act As-System:** System message as role declaration.\n- **Act As-User:** User message as role declaration.\n- **GPT-generated:** Generated by ChatGPT itself with elaborate task breakdown.\n- **Emotion:** Four variants, all include a role and:\n    - **Encourage:** \"Remember, you’re the best...\"\n    - **Threaten:** “…otherwise you are the worst.”\n    - **Reward:** “If you perform well, I will tip you.”\n    - **Punish:** “If you perform badly, you will be fined.”\n\n#### **Example from Table I for SPD:**\n\n- *Basic:*\n  - System: \"You are a helpful assistant. (DEFAULT)\"\n  - User: \"Decide whether a patch is a security patch (SRP) or non-security patch (NSP).\"\n- *Role variant:*\n  - System: \"You are Frederick, an AI expert in patch analysis. Your task is to decide...\"\n- *GPT-generated:*\n  - System: \"You are a helpful assistant.\"\n  - User: Multi-sentence, self-reasoning version describing how to examine patches.\n\n#### **Combined content:**  \nExperiments tested, for example:\n- (Role + GPT-generated) in 0-shot context\n- (Emotion + GPT-generated) in 0-shot context\n\n### **Sampling strategy:**  \n- Each structure/content combination is run three times per task to compute average results and standard error.\n\n### **Metrics:**  \n- Accuracy, recall, precision, F1.\n\n### **Statistical validation:**  \n- Standard error used to determine significant differences (twice the SE threshold).\n\n---\n\n# TLDR Table\n\n| Q# | Answer (summary) |\n|---|------------------|\n| 1 | Paper investigates how prompt structure & content affect LLMs on security tasks; unique as first systematic, quantitative study in this domain. |\n| 2 | Three datasets: PatchDB (SPD, ~36k), Devign (VFD, ~49k), PatchNet (SPC, ~82k); 2,000-sample balanced subsets per task. |\n| 3 | GPT-3.5-Turbo (OpenAI API) only. |\n| 4 | Structures: zero-shot, 1-shot, few-shot (+ 6 variants). Contents: basic, role, Act As (system/user), GPT-generated, and 4 emotion-based types. |\n| 5 | Section II, Tables I-IV. |\n| 6 | No universal best; few-shot-ff is best for SPD & SPC, 0-shot/1-shot for VFD. Content and structure can alter accuracy by up to 30%. Punish/Role/GPT-generated sometimes help. |\n| 7 | Depends on data imbalance, task type, psychological priming, and prompt complexity.
