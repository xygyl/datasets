Here are detailed answers to each of your specific questions, thoroughly referencing the content of the paper *\"Exploring ChatGPT’s Capabilities on Vulnerability Management\"*.\n\n---\n\n### 1. What is the point of this paper? What is it trying to explore? What makes it unique?\n\n#### Point of the Paper & What It Explores\n\nThe paper conducts **the first large-scale, systematic evaluation of ChatGPT's performance on a comprehensive suite of vulnerability management tasks**. Specifically, it investigates:\n\n- **Can ChatGPT assist software maintainers across diverse tasks in the full vulnerability management process**, which includes not only code analysis, but also complex tasks like bug report summarization, security relevance prediction, patch correctness assessment, etc.?\n- **How do various prompt engineering strategies affect ChatGPT's performance on these tasks?**\n- **What are the current difficulties and bottlenecks of using ChatGPT for these tasks, and what promising future directions can be explored to improve ChatGPT’s efficacy?**\n\n#### What Makes It Unique\n\n- **Broad scope:** Unlike prior work that only focused on narrow tasks (such as vulnerability fixing), this work evaluates ChatGPT across 6 distinct tasks that span the *entire vulnerability management lifecycle* (see Figure 1, Table 1).\n- **Scale:** It uses a very large dataset (over 70,000 samples, 19 million+ tokens).\n- **Prompting analysis:** It systematically compares a diverse set of prompt engineering strategies, documenting their effects on different tasks.\n- **Self-heuristic prompting:** It introduces and evaluates a new, *self-heuristic* prompt strategy—where ChatGPT is leveraged to extract and compress expertise from the data and then use that extracted expertise in further prompting.\n- **Direct SOTA Comparison:** Compares ChatGPT (zero/few-shot) to 11 State-of-the-Art domain-specific methods on their own datasets.\n- **Human Study:** It includes a user study (with professional/intermediate developers) for qualitative evaluation.\n\n---\n\n### 2. What dataset did they use?\n\n**Huge, Multi-Task Dataset:**  \n- **Total size:** 70,346 samples (~19.4 million tokens)\n- **Composition:** Datasets from SOTA baselines for each of the 6 tasks (see Table 1), as follows:\n  - **Bug report summarization:** 33,438 samples\n  - **Security bug report identification:** 22,970 samples\n  - **Vulnerability severity evaluation:** 1,642 samples\n  - **Vulnerability repair:** 12 hand-crafted + 10,601 from LLMset (total small due to task difficulty)\n  - **Patch correctness assessment:** 995, 139, & 208 samples across 3 SOTA datasets\n  - **Stable patch classification:** 10,896 samples\n\n**Source:** For each task, they used the publicly available datasets from prior SOTA approaches, ensuring direct comparability.\n\n---\n\n### 3. What LLM models were used?\n\n- **ChatGPT based on gpt-3.5-turbo-0301:**  \n  - Used for initial template selection phases (because of cost).\n- **ChatGPT based on gpt-4-0314:**  \n  - Used for large-scale testing and best-performance evaluations.\n- **Comparison LLMs (for code repair):**  \n  - Codex and AI21’s Jurassic-1 (as studied in LLMset [37]).\n- **Baselines:** 11 SOTA (mostly deep learning or traditional ML) models specific to each task.\n\n---\n\n### 4. What prompting strategies are discussed in this paper?\n\n**Prompt Strategies Evaluated (see Table 2):**\n1. **0-shot:**  \n   Only a task description and input; no examples.\n2. **1-shot:**  \n   Task description + one demonstration example + input.\n3. **Few-shot:**  \n   Task description + multiple random demonstration examples + input.\n4. **General-info:**  \n   Integrates system-level role instructions, task confirmation dialogue, reinforcement, and positive feedback into prompt.\n5. **Expertise:**  \n   Like general-info + *hand-crafted domain expertise* (summarized from docs/literature—Table 14).\n6. **Self-heuristic:**  \n   Like expertise, but *the expertise is generated by ChatGPT* itself, summarizing knowledge from a set of demonstration examples.\n\n**Special cases:**  \n- For some tasks, extra templates such as code-only or desc-code were designed (e.g., for patch correctness assessment).\n\n---\n\n### 5. Where are the prompting strategies explained?\n\n- **Table 2 (Prompt Templates):** Lists and documents each strategy.\n- **Section 3.3 (“Prompt Design and Implementation”):** Offers methodology and discussion on how each prompt strategy is constructed and their rationale.\n- **Appendix (Table 13):** Provides concrete prompt examples for each strategy across different tasks.\n- **Table 14 (Appendix):** Lists the expertise content (for expertise & self-heuristic prompts) for each task and their sources.\n\n---\n\n### 6. What are the results of the prompting strategies and how successful were they?\n\n**Key Results by Strategy:**\n\n- **0-shot:**  \n   - Suffices for “language-centric” tasks (e.g., bug report summarization): ChatGPT outperformed SOTA using just zero-shot.\n   - Poor for logic-heavy code tasks (vulnerability repair, severity), often yields errors or hallucinations.\n- **1-shot/few-shot:**  \n   - Improves over 0-shot for tasks that benefit from examples (e.g., security bug ID), but not a universal win.\n   - May induce \"anchoring\" on irrelevant demonstration details (can hurt precision).\n- **General-info and Expertise:**  \n   - Adding role-play, clarifications, and manually summarized expertise helps significantly, especially for classification or more complex decision tasks.\n   - However, can sometimes *hurt* in language-centric tasks already well-covered by LLM pretraining.\n- **Self-heuristic:**  \n   - Especially beneficial for hard, ambiguous, or data-starved tasks (e.g., vulnerability severity evaluation).\n   - For instance, precision and recall in vulnerability severity task improved dramatically when using expertise *summarized by ChatGPT itself* from demonstration data.\n\n**Overall Success:**\n- **For some tasks, ChatGPT (with suitable prompting, esp. expertise/self-heuristic) surpassed or matched SOTA (e.g., bug report summarization, patch correctness, vulnerability repair).**\n- **In other, more domain-specific tasks, it still lagged behind SOTA unless guided by domain expertise via the prompt.**\n- **Human study confirmed ChatGPT’s superiority in correctness and readability for summarization tasks.**\n\n---\n\n### 7. Why did one strategy give better results than another?\n\n- **Language-centric Tasks:**  \n   - 0-shot worked well due to ChatGPT’s massive pretraining on generic language tasks (e.g., summarization).\n   - Adding complexity in the prompt could introduce confusion or unnecessary details—less is more.\n- **Logic- or Domain-centric Tasks:**  \n   - Plain 0-shot fails: ChatGPT needs explicit domain structure, rules, or patterns, as it cannot infer complex task mappings from generic language alone.\n   - **Expertise/self-heuristic** prompts work better because they encode the rules or summary knowledge explicitly, removing ambiguity and helping ChatGPT “anchor” its reasoning in the specific domain logic.\n   - Self-heuristic strategy leverages ChatGPT’s strength in abstraction/compression—distilling patterns from many examples, then using that distillation as factual guidance.\n- **Too much or irrelevant info (e.g., ill-chosen demonstration examples) can hurt**: ChatGPT can overfit to superficial correlations in demonstration examples, leading to biased predictions (“anchoring” problem).\n\n---\n\n### 8. All specifics of the researcher's prompt strategies.\n\n**Prompts (see Table 2, Table 12, Table 13, Table 14, and main text):**\n\n- **0-shot:**  \n   - The prompt gives only a task description and the input sample.\n   - Example: “USER: Decide whether a bug report is a security bug report (SBR) or non-security bug report (NBR). Bug report: <bugreport> Category:”\n- **1-shot:**  \n   - Adds a single, randomly selected example (with correct output) before the test input.\n   - Example: “... Bug report: Memory Leak in... Category: SBR ### Bug report: <test_bugreport> Category:”\n- **Few-shot:**  \n   - Adds multiple randomly selected demonstration examples (typically 4), formatted as above.\n- **General-info:**  \n   - Uses the “SYSTEM” role to assign ChatGPT a relevant persona (e.g., “You are Frederick, an AI expert in bug report analysis...”).\n   - Reinforces instructions and simulates a dialog (task confirmation, positive feedback).\n   - May include step-by-step (Zero-CoT) logic prompts: “Think step by step...”\n- **Expertise:**  \n   - Like general-info, but adds domain-specific knowledge (from docs/literature).\n   - Example: “When analyzing the bug report, take into account that bug reports related to memory leak or null pointer problems should be seen as security bug reports.”\n- **Self-heuristic:**  \n   - Provides demonstration samples to ChatGPT, asks it to summarize the generic characteristics/rules (e.g., what defines AV:Network for a vulnerability).\n   - Those ChatGPT-generated summaries are then fed as the 'expertise' portion in the final prompt for inference.\n\n**Additional strategies (for task-specific needs):**\n- **Desc-code/code-only:**  \n   - For tasks where only code or code+description is needed (e.g., patch correctness), special templates are used to prevent ChatGPT from misusing context.\n- **Prompt Implementation Details:**  \n   - All template writing, demonstration example selection, instruction tuning were done on training/probe data only; test data never accessed for prompt engineering.\n   - Probe-test datasets (10% random training samples, up to 1,000 for costly tasks) are used for template selection before final testing on the full test set.\n- **Appendix Tables:**  \n   - Table 12 gives prompt skills for general-info (role, reinforce, confirmation, positive feedback, CoT, etc.)\n   - Table 14 specifies task-relevant expertise (taken from Linux kernel docs, CVSS guidelines, prior SOTA papers).\n   - Table 13 shows example prompts per task and per strategy.\n\n---\n\n## In summary\n\n- **The paper systematically explores ChatGPT’s effectiveness across 6 core vulnerability management tasks,** using a large, multi-task dataset, SOTA model comparisons, and multiple prompt strategies.\n- **Prompt strategies—including 0-shot, 1/4-shot, general-info, expertise, and self-heuristic—are clearly explained, systematically evaluated, and compared.**\n- **Advanced prompt strategies (especially expertise and self-heuristic) are often key to unlocking strong performance on logic-heavy or domain-specific tasks.**\n- **Prompt design specifics, examples, and empirical results (by task and strategy) are thoroughly documented in the main text and appendix.**\n\nIf you want concrete example prompts or implementation details for a specific task or prompting strategy, let me know!"
