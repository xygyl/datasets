What is the point of this paper? What is it trying to explore? What makes it unique?\n\n#### **Point & Exploration**\n- The paper systematically **explores ChatGPT’s usefulness in real-world vulnerability management tasks**, covering the **complete vulnerability management process**.\n- It aims to answer:\n  - Can ChatGPT directly assist software maintainers across the full vulnerability management lifecycle?\n  - Can it perform on par with SOTA (state-of-the-art) approaches?\n  - How do prompt engineering strategies and foundational models affect performance?\n  - What are the key challenges, and how can future directions be shaped?\n\n#### **Uniqueness**\n- **First comprehensive, large-scale evaluation**: 6 distinct real-world vulnerability management tasks, 70,346 samples.\n- Not limited to traditional code or NLP tasks, but tests across a real process, e.g., bug report summarization, security bug identification, severity evaluation, code repair, patch correctness, and stable patch classification.\n- **Systematic comparison with 11 SOTA methods** under identical metrics and datasets.\n- Intensive focus on **prompt engineering**, including “self-heuristic” prompting (extracting knowledge using ChatGPT itself).\n- Reveals practical problems: e.g., performance plateaus with random demonstrations; better results by synthesizing domain expertise; misinterpretation risks when information isn't well-curated.\n\n**References:**  \n- Abstract, §1 Introduction (\"Recently, there has been a...\"), §2 Background, Table 1, and §3 Evaluation Framework.\n\n---\n\n### 2. What dataset did they use?\n\n- The paper **collects datasets from the SOTA approaches for each of the six tasks.**\n- **Total:** 70,346 samples, 19,355,711 tokens.\n- Each dataset exactly matches primary SOTA prior works to ensure fairness.\n- Datasets span:\n  - Bug report summarization: 33,438 samples.\n  - Security bug identification: 22,970 samples.\n  - Vulnerability severity evaluation: 1,642 samples.\n  - Vulnerability repair: 12 samples.\n  - Patch correctness assessment: 995–208 samples (depending on the SOTA method).\n  - Stable patch classification: 10,896 samples.\n\n**References:**  \n- Table 1: Tasks, baselines, and dataset (§2), §3.2 SOTA Approaches and Dataset.\n\n---\n\n### 3. What LLM models were used?\n\n- **ChatGPT** (OpenAI models—via API):\n  - **gpt-3.5-turbo-0301**: Used for prompt design and probe-testing (economical & sufficient for preliminary studies).\n  - **gpt-4-0314**: Used for final, large-scale evaluation due to its higher capabilities.\n- **Also compared**: SOTA methods (not LLMs), plus the “LLMset” from Pearce et al. (including Codex and Jurassic-1) for the vulnerability repair task.\n\n**References:**  \n- §2.2 ChatGPT and Prompt, Footnote 1 in §3.2/3.3, Table 6.\n\n---\n\n### 4. What are the prompting strategies discussed in this paper?\n\n- **Six main prompting strategies/templates:**\n  1. **0-shot**: Task description only.\n  2. **1-shot**: One random demonstration/example before input.\n  3. **Few-shot**: Several (4) random demonstration examples.\n  4. **General-info**: Task-related role assignments, instruction reinforcement, dialog prompts, and “zero-shot chain-of-thought” to encourage step-by-step reasoning.\n  5. **Expertise**: As above, but with manually summarized, domain-specific expertise included (e.g., definitions, rules).\n  6. **Self-heuristic**: ChatGPT itself summarizes and extracts expertise from multiple demonstrations/examples, which is then fed back as part of the prompt to guide its task performance.\n\n**References:**  \n- Table 2: Templates for task prompt generation, §2.2 Prompt Strategies, §3.1/3.3 Evaluation Pipeline and Prompt Design.\n\n---\n\n### 5. What specific prompts were used?\n\nDetailed examples are provided in Table 13 and through narrative in §3.3 and Appendix A.  \n**Example for Security Bug Report Identification (expertise):**\n```\nSYSTEM: You are Frederick, an AI expert in bug report analysis. Your task is to decide whether a given bug report is a security bug report (SBR) or non-security bug report (NBR). When analyzing the bug report, take into account that bug reports related to memory leak or null pointer problems should be seen as security bug report...\nUSER: I will give you a bug report and you will analyze it, step by step, to know whether or not it is a security bug report. Got it?\nASSISTANT: Yes, I understand...\nUSER: Great! Let's begin then :) For the bug report: [details] Is this bug report (A) a security bug report (SBR), or (B) a non-security bug report (NBR). Answer: Let's think step-by-step to reach the right conclusion.\n```\n**Other prompt examples exist in Table 13 and the main text, customized for each task.**\n\n**References:**  \n- Table 2, Table 12 (skills for general-info), Table 13 (prompt examples), §3.3 Prompt Design, Appendix A.\n\n---\n\n### 6. Where are the prompt strategies explained?\n\n- **Section 2.2**: High-level prompt design strategies and their context (NLP, in-context learning, role assignment, expertise, etc.)\n- **Section 3.1, 3.3**: Details prompt template construction, selection process, and examples.\n- **Table 2/Tables in Appendix A**: Concrete templates and explanations.\n- **Appendix A/Table 13**: Extensive template and prompt wordings.\n\n---\n\n### 7. What the results of the prompting strategies are and how successful or not were they?\n\n#### **Summary of Results:**\n- **Basic (0-shot) prompts**: Often already strong for tasks close to standard NLP (e.g., bug report summarization).\n- **Demonstration-based (1/few-shot) prompts**: Sometimes improve performance, but randomly chosen demos are not always reliable.\n- **Expertise prompts**: Notable improvements when domain knowledge is crucial (e.g., security bug identification, stable patch classification).\n- **Self-heuristic prompts**:\n  - Particularly strong for tasks requiring delicate domain knowledge condensation (e.g., CVSS severity mapping).\n  - Extracting and synthesizing knowledge with ChatGPT, then feeding it back, yielded *substantially higher scores* compared to random or naïve demonstrations (see Table 5).\n- **Too much or ill-formed information**:\n  - Can result in *lower* scores, hallucinations, or model confusion (e.g., in patch correctness, stable patch tasks), underscoring the importance of curating what, and how much, is fed to ChatGPT.\n\n**Task-specific examples:**\n- **Bug Report Summarization**: 0-shot competitive; few-shot (esp. gpt-4) best; general-info/expertise sometimes unnecessary.\n- **Security Bug Report Identification**: Raw demonstrations can inject noise; expertise prompts clarify and boost recall.\n- **Vulnerability Severity Evaluation**: Only self-heuristic prompts led to strong results, as the model struggled with rule abstraction otherwise.\n- **Patch Correctness/Stable Patch**: Too much irrelevant info can *harm* accuracy—direct, high-quality signals are essential.\n\n**References:**  \n- Tables 3–11, Evaluation Results Section 4 and per-task subsections (4.1–4.6).\n\n---\n\n### 8. Why did one strategy give better results than another?\n\n- **Relevance and quality of information**: Expertise and self-heuristic prompts explicitly provide or extract task-relevant *rules* or *patterns* that LLMs otherwise fail to infer, especially in complex, nuanced tasks.\n- **Random demonstrations are risky**: They can statistically introduce bias or noise, causing the model to latch onto irrelevant demo details instead of learning correct task patterns.\n- **Information overload**: Excessive or non-specific details (e.g., bug reports with patch code, description, and auxiliary information together) can distract or misguide the model, leading to hallucinations or false reasoning chains.\n- **Self-heuristic summarization**: Works best when *rules or patterns* are non-trivial or difficult to encode by hand, as the model can find and synthesize patterns across many demos more effectively than humans or random selection.\n- **Model capacity matters**: gpt-4 generally outperforms gpt-3.5, but gains are pronouned only if prompts capture necessary task structure and domain knowledge.\n\n**Relevant findings:**\n- \"Providing random demonstration examples in the prompt cannot consistently guarantee good performance...\"\n- “Extracting expertise from demonstration examples itself and integrating the extracted expertise...is a promising research direction…”\n\n**References:**  \n- Summary in Abstract, per-task analysis in Section 4, especially 4.2 (identification), 4.3 (severity).\n\n---\n\n### 9. All specifics of the researcher's prompt strategies.\n\n#### **Prompt Strategies & Implementation Details**\n\n| Strategy        | Description & Implementation Notes                                                                                                |\n|-----------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| 0-shot          | Just task description + the query input.                                                    |\n| 1-shot          | Task description + one random demo (from training set) + input query.                       |\n| Few-shot        | Task description + four random demos + input query. Number of demos chosen per [23].        |\n| General-info    | System prompt sets a role (e.g., \"You are Frederick...\"), reinforces with task info, simulates human-AI dialogue confirmation, includes positive feedback, chain-of-thought (\"Let's think step by step\"), and prompts for a 'right' answer. Skills in Table 12. |\n| Expertise       | Like general-info, but adds task/domain-specific expertise (rules, definitions, summarized from literature or documentation). e.g., specific rules for what constitutes a security bug, or CVSS metric, etc. See Table 14 for resource mappings. |\n| Self-heuristic  | ChatGPT is used to *summarize* expertise from many demos (drawn from training/probe set), and the resulting essence is fed into subsequent system/user prompts (as expertise in the template). E.g., providing 100 labeled examples, asking for a summary of what characterizes CVSS Network metrics, etc.; see Figure 4.                      |\n| Desc-code/code-only (Patch correctness)| For patch correctness, they adapted prompt form after noticing model confusion when giving both code and description. “code-only” inputs proved more accurate than combined inputs. |\n| Variability Control in Evaluation | All prompt testing, selection, and refinement was carried out using only the training/probe data; test data was untouched to ensure evaluation integrity.|\n| Prompt Template Selection | Each strategy first tested on probe-test (small random selection of training data), and the best-performing template per-task used for final large-scale test.                |\n\n**References:**  \n- Table 2, Table 12, Table 13 (Appendix A), §3.1–3.3; Figures 3–4 in main text; evaluation method details, and further template specifics in the appendix.\n\n---\n\n## Short summary (one-liner per question)\n\n1. **The paper aims for the first large-scale study of ChatGPT across all major vulnerability MGMT tasks, evaluates its strengths/limits, with unique focus on prompt optimization and comparison with SOTAs.**\n2. **Datasets are adopted from previous SOTA works for each task, totaling 70,346 samples.**\n3. **Models: ChatGPT (gpt-3.5-turbo-0301 for prototyping, gpt-4-0314 for main tests); also comparisons to Codex, Jurassic-1 etc. in one task.**\n4. **Prompting strategies: 0-shot, 1-shot, few-shot, general-info, expertise, and self-heuristic (ChatGPT-extracted knowledge), plus special variants for code/desc.**\n5. **Specific tasks had tailored prompts; formats and text examples are provided in main text/Table 13—ranging from simple role+input, to detailed expert instructions and examples.**\n6. **Strategies are explained in Section 2.2, 3.1, 3.3, and Tables 2, 12, 13—with worked examples in the appendix.**\n7. **0-shot/few-shot suffice for simple NLP tasks; domain expertise/self-heuristic are needed for complex tasks; excess/noisy info can hurt; best results come from curating useful knowledge.**\n8. **Strategies succeed/fail based on their ability to deliver distilled, relevant expertise; random or too much info confuses, while precise synthesis (esp. with self-heuristic prompts) lifts performance.**\n9. **Prompt strategies were carefully constructed, selected via probe-tests, included role assignment, domain expertise, and model self-summary; all templates and their selection process are explicitly detailed (see Table 2, 12, 13, and respective sections).**\n\n---\n\n**If you want a table mapping tasks to prompt templates and results, or further breakdown per task, just let me know!**"
