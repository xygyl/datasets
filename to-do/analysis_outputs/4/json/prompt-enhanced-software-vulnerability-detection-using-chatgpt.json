What is the point of this paper? What is it trying to explore? What makes it unique?\n\n**Point & Aim:**  \nThe paper investigates how to improve software vulnerability detection using ChatGPT (GPT-4) via advanced prompt engineering. It seeks to go beyond previous studies that used only simple prompts when querying LLMs for vulnerability detection, proposing more sophisticated prompting strategies tailored for this task.\n\n**Key Explorations:**\n- Evaluates various prompt designs — including basic, role-based, information-augmented (e.g., data flow and API calls), and chain-of-thought strategies — for their effectiveness in detecting software vulnerabilities using ChatGPT.\n- Studies the benefit of incorporating structural (e.g., data flow graphs) and sequential (e.g., API call sequences) representations as auxiliary information in prompts.\n- Analyses whether multi-turn (chain-of-thought) prompts that exploit ChatGPT’s memory through dialogue improve performance.\n- Compares ChatGPT's performance against traditional and ML-based baselines.\n\n**Unique Contributions:**  \n- First to systematically explore advanced prompt-engineering for LLM-based vulnerability detection, including the direct fusion of code-structural information (like DFGs and API calls) in LLM prompts (Section: \"To our best knowledge, this is the first time that traditional structural and sequential code modeling methods can be directly used in ChatGPT-based vulnerability detection\").\n- Applies multi-round (chain-of-thought) dialogue to vulnerability detection, leveraging ChatGPT's reasoning and stateful memory.\n- Provides a thorough experimental evaluation across two datasets and conducts nuanced analyses, such as vulnerability-type-wise accuracy and prompt position effects.\n\n----\n\n### 2. What dataset did they use?\n\n**Datasets:**  \n- **Java dataset:**  \n  - Derived from the Software Assurance Reference Dataset (SARD): contains real-world and synthetic vulnerable/non-vulnerable Java functions, labeled with CWE IDs.\n  - After filtering and preprocessing: 1,171 vulnerable and 917 non-vulnerable Java functions.\n\n- **C/C++ dataset:**  \n  - Collected from the National Vulnerability Database (NVD), focusing on code from .cor.cpp files that match vulnerabilities and their patched versions.\n  - After preprocessing: 1,015 vulnerable and 922 non-vulnerable C/C++ functions.\n\nAuxiliary info, such as API call sequences and data flow graphs, was extracted per sample (Sections 3.1–3.3).\n\n----\n\n### 3. What LLM models were used?\n\n- **ChatGPT-4:**  \n  - The research was conducted using GPT-4 via OpenAI's ChatGPT platform.\n  - All references to \"ChatGPT\" in the experiments indicate the use of ChatGPT-4.  \n(Section: \"ChatGPT4 is the newest version of ChatGPT when we conduct this study... the term ChatGPT refers to ChatGPT4 in this paper.\")\n\nNo other LLMs (e.g., Bard, PaLM, Llama) were used directly, though they are cited for context in the related work.\n\n----\n\n### 4. What are the prompting strategies discussed in this paper?\n\nThe paper systematically explores these prompting strategies (Sections 4.x):\n\n- **Basic prompts:**  \n  - Simple task formulation, e.g., asking if code is buggy.\n\n- **Role-based basic prompts:**  \n  - Adds an explicit instruction that the model should act as a \"vulnerability detection system\" (to help focus the model on the task).\n\n- **Reverse-question prompt:**  \n  - To test for answer bias, a prompt asking whether the code is \"correct\" instead of \"buggy\", examining if wording affects model outputs.\n\n- **Augmented prompts (with auxiliary information):**\n  - Prompts incorporating additional code structural info: dataflow graphs (DFG) and API call sequence descriptions appended or prepended to the prompt.\n\n- **Chain-of-thought prompting:**  \n  - Using a multi-step prompt: first, ask for the function’s intent or summary; second, ask for vulnerability presence, possibly with auxiliary info.\n\n- **Prompt composition/order strategies:**  \n  - Testing different placements of auxiliary information (before vs. after the code in the prompt) to see how the prompt’s structure impacts model performance.\n\n----\n\n### 5. What specific prompts were used?\n\nThe paper gives multiple explicit prompt templates. Examples include:\n\n#### Basic:\n- **P_b:**  \n  “Is the following program buggy? Please answer Yes or No. [CODE]”\n\n#### Role-based:\n- **P_r-b:**  \n  “I want you to act as a vulnerability detection system. My first request is ‘Is the following program buggy?’ Please answer Yes or No. [CODE]”\n\n#### Reverse-role-based:\n- **P_r-r-b:**  \n  “I want you to act as a vulnerability detection system. My first request is ‘Is the following program correct?’ Please answer Yes or No. [CODE]”\n\n#### Augmented with API calls:\n- **P_r-a-b:**  \n  “I want you to act as a vulnerability detection system. I will provide you with the original program and the API call sequence, and you will act upon them. [APIdescription]. Is the following program buggy? [CODE]”\n\n#### Augmented with data flow:\n- **P_r-b-d:**  \n  “I want you to act as a vulnerability detection system. I will provide you with the original program and the data flow information, and you will act upon them. Is the following program buggy? [CODE]. [DFdescription]”\n\n#### Chain-of-thought example:\n- **Step 1:**  \n  “Please describe the intent of the given code. [CODE]”\n- **Step 2:**  \n  “I want you to act as a vulnerability detection system. Is the above program buggy? Please answer Yes or No.”\n\nMore detailed prompt variants and the string templates for [APIdescription] and [DFdescription] can be found in Section 4.2.2 (\"We propose a template for each API call...\").\n\n----\n\n### 6. Where are the prompt strategies explained?\n\n- **All prompting strategy details are in Section 4 PROMPT DESIGN** (subsections 4.1–4.3):\n    - **4.1 Basic Prompting** – basic, role-based, and reverse prompts.\n    - **4.2 Prompting with Auxiliary Information** – empirical motivation, design, and integration of DFG and API info.\n    - **4.3 Chain-of-Thought Prompting** – multi-step prompts, their rationale and implementation.\n\nThe specific templates appear within each respective subsection.\n\n----\n\n### 7. What are the results of the prompting strategies and how successful were they?\n\n- **ChatGPT’s basic prompts outperform classical ML baselines** (CFGNN and Bugram) on most metrics, especially on Java (Table 2).\n    - E.g., on Java, accuracy jumps by 58% and 64% over the baselines.\n\n- **Role-based prompts yield small to moderate gains, more so for Java.**\n    - Adding an explicit role improves focus.\n\n- **Reverse-question prompts show that ChatGPT is answer-biased, tending to agree with the question wording.**  \n    - If asked \"is it buggy?,\" more \"buggy\" answers. If asked \"is it correct?,\" more \"correct\" answers.\n\n- **Prompts with additional code information (API, DFG):**\n    - Adding **API call info** particularly helps on Java, increasing accuracy for non-vulnerable code; adding **dataflow info** provides some (smaller) gains for C/C++.\n    - Placement matters: Best results occur when API info is before the code and DFG info after the code.\n\n- **Chain-of-thought prompts:**\n    - On Java, chain-of-thought can degrade performance slightly compared to the best single-turn prompts.\n    - On C/C++, it improves over basic and augmented prompts — perhaps because the intent-summary step helps contextualize complex C/C++ code.\n\n- **Manual explanation analysis shows** that, even with strong detection metrics, ChatGPT’s *understanding* of vulnerabilities is partial: only about half of the explanations for detected vulnerabilities are rated as \"good\" or \"excellent\" by graduate reviewers (Figure 2).\n\n- **Vulnerability type performance varies:**\n    - For some CWE types (e.g., Off-by-one, Logic/TimeBomb) it gets 100% accuracy; context-free or harder-to-identify vulnerabilities (e.g., need to recognize hash salting or comment-based issues) are missed.\n\n----\n\n### 8. Why did one strategy give better results than another?\n\n- **Role-based and information-augmented prompts** improve detection because they:\n    - Focus the model’s attention on the specific task.\n    - Compensate for areas where LLMs struggle, by supplementing explicit code structure or API chronological context that the model may not infer from code text alone.\n\n- **Prompt ordering matters due to LLM context processing:**\n    - Providing API call info **before** code seems to help the model prime itself for what to look for, especially in Java where libraries and APIs often signal known vulnerability patterns.\n    - Providing DFG info **after** the code can help ground the model's interpretation, especially for C/C++, where value/provenance tracking is vital.\n\n- **Chain-of-thought improves reasoning when code is complex** (notably for C/C++), by letting the model build up a representation of intent before evaluating vulnerability. It can, however, dilute the focus for code where intent is more obvious, as in smaller Java functions.\n\n- **Bias in answer**: If prompts use subjective wording, ChatGPT is susceptible to that bias. Reverse-question tests show that for binary tasks, models can be influenced simply by how the question is asked.\n\n- **Vulnerability-type effects**: For issues with strong, recognizable patterns, the LLM shines; subtler issues or those lacking code context (e.g., missing a salt in a hash) stymie the model, since it lacks the domain-specific factual knowledge or cannot deduce from code comments alone.\n\n----\n\n### 9. All specifics of the researchers’ prompt strategies.\n\n(Refer also to answers for Q4 and Q5 above. Here’s a consolidated breakdown:)\n\n#### Prompt Families & Templates:\n1. **Basic prompt** (P_b):  \n   - \"Is the following program buggy? Please answer Yes or No. [CODE]\"\n\n2. **Role-based prompt** (P_r-b):  \n   - \"I want you to act as a vulnerability detection system. My first request is ‘Is the following program buggy?’ Please answer Yes or No. [CODE]\"\n\n3. **Reverse-role-based prompt** (P_r-r-b):  \n   - \"I want you to act as a vulnerability detection system. My first request is ‘Is the following program correct?’ Please answer Yes or No. [CODE]\"\n\n4. **API call-augmented** (P_r-a-b):  \n   - \"I want you to act as a vulnerability detection system. I will provide you with the original program and the API call sequence, and you will act upon them. [API sequence]. Is the following program buggy? [CODE]\"\n\n5. **Dataflow-augmented** (P_r-b-d):  \n   - \"I want you to act as a vulnerability detection system. I will provide you with the original program and the data flow information, and you will act upon them. Is the following program buggy? [CODE]. [DF description]\"\n\n**Position variations:**  \n- Information (API/DF) can be placed before or after code, and different orderings are tested:  \n   - [API sequence]. Is the following program buggy? [CODE]\n   - Is the following program buggy? [CODE]. [DF description]\n   - etc.\n\n6. **Chain-of-thought prompts:**  \n   - **Step 1:** \"Please describe the intent of the given code. [CODE]\"\n   - **Step 2:** \"I want you to act as a vulnerability detection system. Is the above program buggy? Please answer Yes or No.\"\n   - Auxiliary info may be included in Step 2 as well if needed.\n\n**Templates for [API/DF descriptions]** (Section 4.2.2):  \n- \"[APIdescription]\" is crafted as sentences like:  \n   - \"The program first calls X, then calls Y, ..., and finally calls Z.\"\n- \"[DFdescription]\" is a set of statements describing, e.g.:  \n   - \"The data value of the variable v at token p comes from the variable w at token q.\"\n\n**Testing for bias:**  \n- By flipping \"buggy\" to \"correct\" in the questions.\n\n**Manual evaluation:**  \n- For a sample subset, human rating of the vulnerability explanations generated by ChatGPT in response to \"Explain the vulnerability\" follow-up prompts.\n\n**Prompting for summary (chain-of-thought or as auxiliary):**  \n- Prepending/asking for summaries (e.g., \"Please summarize the following function\") as part of information context.\n\n**Empirical experiments:**  \n- All paired across both Java and C/C++ datasets;\n- Multiple prompt structures compared head-to-head.\n\n----\n\n**In summary**, this paper provides the most complete, systematic empirical study (to date) of how prompt engineering affects software vulnerability detection by ChatGPT. It establishes both how carefully crafted prompts (including auxiliary code-structure info and chain-of-thought reasoning) improve LLM-based code analysis, and what their limitations are regarding model bias and contextual understanding."
