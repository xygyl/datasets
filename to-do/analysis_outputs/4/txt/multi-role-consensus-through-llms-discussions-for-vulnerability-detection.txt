### 1. What is the point of this paper? What is it trying to explore? What makes it unique?

**Point:**  
The paper aims to improve code vulnerability detection by using Large Language Models (LLMs) in a more realistic and collaborative way—by simulating multi-role code reviews (e.g., both "developer" and "tester" perspectives), rather than just a single LLM role.

**Exploration:**  
It investigates whether LLMs performing as both testers and developers, and engaging in a discussion to reach consensus, can achieve better vulnerability detection accuracy than simply asking an LLM in a "tester" role to review code.

**Uniqueness:**  
- Unlike prior work focusing only on a single tester perspective (single-role), it introduces a **multi-role, dialogue-based consensus mechanism**, more closely mimicking real-life code reviews.
- It measures the impact of discussion and role diversity on detection metrics (precision, recall, F1).

### 2. What dataset did they use?

**Dataset:**
- A C/C++ vulnerability dataset referenced from [6] (Z. Li et al., “Sysevr: A framework for using deep learning to detect software vulnerabilities,” 2022).
- Contains both vulnerable and non-vulnerable code segments.
- Four vulnerability categories:  
    - Function call (FC)
    - Arithmetic expression (AE)
    - Array usage (AU)
    - Pointer usage (PU)
- Three testing groups with varying proportions of vulnerable/non-vulnerable code (details in Table I).

### 3. What LLM models were used?

**LLMs used:**
- All experiments use the **gpt-3.5-turbo-0125** model.

---

### 4. What are the prompting strategies discussed in this paper?

**Prompting strategies:**
- **Single-role:** One LLM instance acts as a tester and makes the vulnerability judgment alone.
- **Multi-role:** Separate LLMs act in different roles (tester and developer), discussing and exchanging judgments/disagreements to reach a final consensus.
- For both above, the following are applied:
    - **Basic prompt:** Directly asks whether the code contains the specified vulnerability.
    - **Chain-of-Thought (CoT):** Steps through reasoning explicitly in the prompt/response.

---

### 5. What specific prompts were used?

**Specifics:**
- **Basic prompt:**  
  Simply asks the LLM if the provided code segment contains a vulnerability in any of the designated categories (FC, AE, AU, PU).
- **CoT prompt:**  
  Asks the LLM to analyze in a step-by-step, explain-your-reasoning manner for the same task.

*Exact text not given in full, but the structure is described as:*
- **Tester initial prompt:** Specifies role as tester, includes task, role, code segment, and asks for a binary answer ("1" for vulnerable, "0" for non-vulnerable) plus a brief (token-limited) justification.
- **Developer initial prompt:** Receives previous tester's response and is similarly prompted for judgment and reasoning.

---

### 6. Where are the prompt strategies explained?

- In section **2. MULTI-ROLE APPROACH**, initialization stage and discussion stage.
- Explicit mention of prompt types in **3.1 Experiment Settings**: “…the following two types of prompts are used to test these two approaches. The basic prompt directly asks the LLM… Chain-of-thought (CoT), i.e., step-by-step, is also used…”

---

### 7. What are the results of the prompting strategies and how successful were they?

**Results:**
- Table I presents precision, recall, and F1 scores for single-role vs. multi-role, for both basic and CoT prompting.
- **Multi-role outperforms single-role** in all main metrics across test groups and categories:
    - **Avg. improvement**:  
        - Precision: +13.48%
        - Recall: +18.25%
        - F1 Score: +16.13%
    - Improvements were even more obvious for high-vulnerability test sets.
    - Multi-role with CoT generally performs best.
    - Cost: Multi-role needs much more computation (~484% more tokens used) due to conversation.

---

### 8. Why did one strategy give better results than another?

**Reason:**
- **Discussion rounds enable LLMs to explore a broader range of potential vulnerabilities, and provide checks/corrections through dialogue.**
- Developer/tester role-play means the initial decision can be challenged and corrected—e.g., if the tester is wrong, the developer may point out safeguards, leading to the tester correcting the verdict.
- This collaborative, dialectic process more closely simulates effective human code review teams and thus yields better performance.

### 9. All specifics of the researcher’s prompt strategies.

**Summary of the approach:**

- **Initialization Stage:**  
    - Tester LLM receives a role-specific prompt:
        - Details their role (tester)
        - Outlines the task (judge if code is vulnerable, and in which category)
        - Code snippet included
        - Output is binary (1/0) plus a brief reasoning (token-limited for clarity)
    - Tester’s initial response is passed to the developer LLM, who is prompted likewise, but with visibility into tester’s answer.

- **Discussion Stage:**  
    - LLMs "converse" (alternating prompts/answers for up to 5 rounds) with each exchange including the latest reasoning and judgments.
    - Each LLM reconsiders and potentially updates its prior answer based on counterpart’s argument.
    - The process continues until consensus or maximum depth.

- **Conclusion Stage:**  
    - Last tester judgment is taken as the final answer.

- **Prompt Variants:**  
    - **Basic prompt:** Ask for vulnerability status without asking for stepwise reasoning.
    - **Chain-of-thought prompt:** Specifically instructs LLM to reason step-by-step.

- **Constraints:**
    - Max. 5 rounds of discussion
    - Max 120 tokens per response

- **Metrics:**
    - Precision, Recall, F1 Score measured on detection results.

- **Single-role baseline:**  
    - Tester LLM does all as a solo agent, with both basic and CoT prompts for comparison.
