**Prompting Strategies in "Exploring the Influence of Prompts in LLMs for Security-Related Tasks"**

---

1. **Where Prompting Strategies Are Explained**

Prompting strategies are explained in Section II of the paper, specifically in parts B (Prompt Structure) and C (Prompt Content). The study further contextualizes these strategies in the assessment of LLMs (Large Language Models) across three real-world security-related tasks, providing a comprehensive framework to analyze both prompt structure and prompt content.

---

2. **Prompt Structures**

The authors define 'prompt structure' as the overarching format or framework of a prompt. The primary structural patterns evaluated are:

- **Zero-shot**: Simple task description followed by the query, with no context/examples provided.
- **One-shot**: Adds a single, randomly chosen demonstration example before the query.
- **Few-shot**: Includes multiple demonstration examples to provide a wider array of context.

To deepen the analysis, the researchers create structural variants by controlling not just the number, but also the type (positive/true vs. negative/false class) and order of examples. They introduce six main structures:

- **1-shot-t**: Task description + one positive-class example.
- **1-shot-f**: Task description + one negative-class example.
- **few-shot-tt**: Task description + two positive-class examples.
- **few-shot-ff**: Task description + two negative-class examples.
- **few-shot-tf**: Task description + one positive followed by one negative example.
- **few-shot-ft**: Task description + one negative followed by one positive example.

This systematic combination enables analysis of how specific example types and their sequencing affect LLM performance on security tasks.

---

3. **Prompt Content**

Prompt content refers to the specific sentences, stylistic elements, and additional contextual information included in the prompt. The paper explores nine content variants:

- **Basic**: Plain task description, e.g., “Decide whether a patch is a security patch (SRP) or non-security patch (NSP).”
- **GPT-generated**: Prompts autonomously generated by ChatGPT, often longer and mimic a reasoning process, e.g., “Let’s start by examining the patch notes or changelog for key terms…”
- **Role**: Specifies a custom system role, e.g., “You are Frederick, an AI expert in patch analysis.”
- **Act As**: Changes role approach by starting with “Act as an expert in patch analysis,” implemented as both system-content ("Act As-system") and user-content ("Act As-user").
- **Emotion**: Adds psychological/emotional cues to the prompt, subdivided into:
    - **Encourage**: Motivational phrases (e.g., “Remember, you’re the best and will use your expertise…”)
    - **Threaten**: Cautionary/mildly negative consequences (“…otherwise you are the worst.”)
    - **Reward**: Incentivizing positive outcomes (“If you perform well, I will generously tip you.”)
    - **Punish**: Negative reinforcement (“If you perform badly, you will be fined.”)

These content variants probe whether nuanced language, domain expertise signals, or simulated psychological effects impact LLM output in security contexts.

---

4. **Research-Specific Context and Implementation**

- **Tasks Evaluated**: 
    - *Security Patch Detection (SPD)*
    - *Vulnerable Function Detection (VFD)*
    - *Stable Patch Classification (SPC)*

- **Datasets**: Open-source, labeled datasets containing both code and descriptive/natural language content.

- **Error Estimation**: The authors address LLM randomness/noise by enforcing controlled, replicable prompt patterns, facilitating meaningful comparison of different strategies.

---

5. **Results of the Prompting Strategies**

- **Performance Variation**: The choice of prompt structure and content significantly affects LLM performance on all three security-related tasks.
    - Different prompt structures (e.g., zero-shot vs. few-shot) and contents (e.g., emotionally charged vs. neutral) led to substantial variation in accuracy.

- **Quantitative Outcomes**:
    - In the three tasks (SPD, VFD, SPC), altering prompts improved LLM accuracy from:
        - SPD: **41.1%** to **60.2%**
        - VFD: **22.9%** to **53.55%**
        - SPC: **40.5%** to **53.65%**

- **Successful Approaches**:
    - Well-designed few-shot and contextually rich prompts (structural and content-based) lead to higher LLM effectiveness.
    - Some role definitions and emotionally-augmented prompts showed notable effectiveness, though improper prompt construction could decrease performance—emphasizing prompt sensitivity.

- **Noteworthy Observations**:
    - The combination of various prompt contents can further enhance LLMs’ outputs beyond basic or isolated modifications.
    - ChatGPT-generated prompts often exhibited interesting reasoning chains, sometimes outperforming basic manual prompts in complex or ambiguous tasks.

- **Failure Points**:
    - Poorly constructed, ambiguous, or conflicting prompts reduce accuracy.
    - Prompt effectiveness is highly task-sensitive and not all strategies universally yield improvement.

---

7. **Conclusion**

This research provides a systematic empirical evaluation of how prompt structure and prompt content affect LLM performance for security-related tasks. The main takeaway is that prompt engineering—both in structure and content—is critical for maximizing LLM utility in specialized domains like security analysis. There is no universally optimal strategy; rather, effectiveness depends on careful design tailored to both the task and dataset at hand.

Prompting Strategies in Security Patch and Vulnerability Function Detection
==========================================================================

1. **Overview and Context**
----------------------------

The paper investigates the effectiveness of prompt engineering—specifically, the structure and content of prompts—when using GPT-3.5-turbo for automated security patch detection (SPD), vulnerable function detection (VFD), and stable patch classification (SPC). The authors carefully design various prompt strategies and systematically compare their impact on model performance across multiple evaluation metrics: accuracy, recall, precision, and F1 score.

2. **Prompt Structures**
------------------------

The researchers analyze several distinct prompt structures. These are detailed in the main body and summarized in Tables II, III, and IV ("Result of Task-XXX in different prompt structures and contents"). The structures are as follows:

  - **0-shot:** The model is not given any examples in the prompt; it receives only the task instruction and single input.
  - **1-shot-t:** The model receives a single example of a positive case (target label is True).
  - **1-shot-f:** The model receives a single example of a negative case (target label is False).
  - **few-shot-tt:** The prompt includes two consecutive examples of positive cases.
  - **few-shot-ff:** The prompt includes two consecutive examples of negative cases.
  - **few-shot-ft:** The prompt includes a negative example followed by a positive example.
  - **few-shot-tf:** The prompt includes a positive example followed by a negative example.

These structures are tested across different tasks and with several system message stylings (see below).

3. **Prompt Content Styles**
----------------------------

The researchers further vary the “content” of the prompts, i.e., the phrasing and context in which the task is described. The styles are:

  - **basic:** Standard, neutral instruction.
  - **ActAs-User:** The model is told to act as a user.
  - **GPT-generated:** Instructions or examples are generated by GPT itself.
  - **role:** The model is assigned a specific professional role.
  - **ActAs-System:** The model is told to act as a system.
  - **Encourage, Threaten, Reward, Punish:** Variations that encourage correct answers, threaten consequences for mistakes, or promise reward/punishment for performance, as psychological motivators.

4. **Where Prompting Strategies Are Explained**
-----------------------------------------------

- **Prompt structure and content** are introduced and exemplified in **Table I (Prompt Content Example for SPD)**.
- Methodology and specific prompt formulations are elaborated in the **Experiment setup section** (“A. Experiment setup”), under “Data Sampling,” and the tables reporting results (Tables II, III, IV).
- The statistical comparison of prompting strategies appears under the **Evaluation** and **The influence of prompt structures for different security-related tasks** sections.

5. **Results of Prompting Strategies**
--------------------------------------

**a. Security Patch Detection (SPD) [Table II]:**
- **Best structure for accuracy, recall, and F1:** *few-shot-ff* consistently outperforms all other structures.
- **Best for precision:** *1-shot-t* structure leads in all conditions.
- Recommendation: For overall good results or minimizing false negatives, use *few-shot-ff*. For minimizing false positives, use *1-shot-t*.

**b. Vulnerable Function Detection (VFD) [Table III]:**
- **Best for precision:** *1-shot-t* often has the best precision (6 of 9 cases).
- **Best for recall and F1:** *0-shot* structure is superior in most settings (7 of 9 cases).
- Reason: Due to the diversity in vulnerability types, few examples may not generalize well; thus, examples do not improve performance much, and sometimes even degrade it.

**c. Stable Patch Classification (SPC) [Table IV]:**
- The results show less pronounced differences and are generally less conclusive, with small performance deltas among structures.

**d. Effects of Prompt Content:**
- The impact of prompt content (how the task is phrased, the role the model is asked to take, the motivational cues) is less consistent than that of structure; differences are subtle, and sometimes content changes do not outperform the basic neutral style significantly.

6. **Statistical Analysis**
---------------------------
The paper defines a superiority criterion: A difference in performance between two scenarios is only considered significant if it is at least twice the standard error (SE). SEs are provided for each metric, ensuring that only meaningful deviations are considered impactful.

7. **Summary of Success and Failure**
--------------------------------------

- **Few-shot-ff** is most successful for security patch detection, especially for balanced performance (accuracy, recall, F1).
- **1-shot-t** excels when precision is critical.
- For vulnerable function detection, **0-shot** is best for recall/F1, while **1-shot-t** is best for precision.
- Variations in **prompt content** (role-based, motivational) had less effect than variations in example structure.
- Providing too few or unrepresentative examples (especially in diverse tasks like VFD) can degrade performance rather than improve it.

8. **Specifics of Prompt Design**
----------------------------------

- Each experiment sampled 2,000 datapoints per task (1,000 pos, 1,000 neg), standardized to minimize bias.
- Prompted completions followed structured output to allow automated accuracy calculation.
- The experiments systematically compared not only *structure* (number/type of examples) but also *framing* (content style) for all three tasks, resulting in 69 small tasks per dataset, totaling 207 experiments, plus additional for error estimation.

9. **Conclusion**
------------------

Prompt engineering for security-related LLM tasks is most effective when the prompt structure matches the task goals (few-shot for recall/balance, 1-shot-t for precision). Prompt content (how the task is described or motivated) has secondary impact. Example representativeness and diversity matter—mismatched examples can reduce, rather than increase, performance.

Prompting Strategies in LLM-Based Security Tasks: Summary  
===================================================================

1. Introduction  
---------------------
The paper investigates the effects of various prompting strategies on the performance of large language models (LLMs), specifically GPT-3.5-Turbo, in the context of three security-related tasks:
- Stable Patch Classification (SPC)
- Vulnerable Function Detection (VFD)
- Security Patch Detection (SPD)

The primary aim is to assess which prompt structures and contents are most effective at enhancing LLM performance for each task, and to evaluate the impact of combining different prompt contents.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

2. Types of Prompting Strategies  
----------------------------------------
Prompt strategies evaluated in the paper are divided along two main axes:

A. **Prompt Structure**  
  - Zero-shot (0-shot)
  - One-shot (1-shot-f, i.e., one example used as context)
  - Few-shot (few-shot-ff, i.e., several examples used as context)

B. **Prompt Content**  
  - Basic (task instructions only)
  - Role-related (e.g., Act As-User, Role, Act As-System)
  - Emotion-related (Encourage, Threaten, Reward, Punish)
  - GPT-generated (prompts written/generated by GPT itself)
  - Combinations of Role/Emotion contents with GPT-generated

**References in the text:**  
- Main discussion on prompt types: Section "C. The effectiveness of different prompt contents across applications"
- Table V (and main text) presents detailed results of combinations

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

3. Explanation of Prompt Strategies  
--------------------------------------------

A. **Prompt Structures**
  - **0-shot:** No examples provided; only instructions.
  - **1-shot:** One illustrative example included.
  - **Few-shot-ff:** Several diverse examples provided, intended to "fine-tune" the model in context.

B. **Prompt Contents**
  - **Role-related:** The prompt assigns a role (e.g., system, user) to guide LLM behavior.
  - **Emotion-related:** The prompt appeals to emotions (encouragement, threat, reward, punishment).
  - **GPT-generated:** The LLM itself generates or refines the prompt through a meta-prompting approach.
  - **Combination prompts:** Combinations of above (excluding combinations of role and emotion, as emotion prompts embed role info).

**Locations/Explanations:**
- "In this subsection, we aim to answer the research question: What types of prompt content are effective in enhancing the performance of LLMs for security tasks?"
- "We first categorize the prompt content into Role-related content, Emotion-related content, and GPT-generated."
- "In this evaluation, we combine Role-related with GPT-generated and Emotion-related with GPT-generated under the 0-shot prompt structure."

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

4. Results of Prompting Strategies  
----------------------------------------

### 4.1 Prompt Structure Results

- **Few-shot-ff** yields the best performance in most cases using recall or F1 as metrics for the SPC and SPD tasks, indicating fewer false negatives and generally more favorable outcomes.
- **1-shot-f** structure performs best in precision and accuracy in 6 out of 9 metrics, suggesting lower incidence of false positives.
- For **VFD**, neither 1-shot nor few-shot significantly outperformed 0-shot, likely due to the diversity of vulnerabilities, making it hard for in-context examples to cover cases comprehensively.

### 4.2 Prompt Content Results

- **SPC Task:**  
  - Changing prompt content generally does NOT enhance performance except for the 0-shot structure.
  - Using GPT-generated content with non-0-shot structures actually yields inferior results compared to basic content.
- **SPD Task:**  
  - Enhancing prompt content usually improves performance, EXCEPT for GPT-generated in 1-shot-f context.
- **VFD Task:**  
  - GPT-generated prompt does best for recall and F1, but basic content is superior for accuracy and precision.

### 4.3 Combination Prompt Results

- Combining prompt contents (Role + GPT-generated or Emotion + GPT-generated) only rarely (about 9.7% of cases) leads to better results than using the best single content.
- Most combinations (52%) result in performance between the two original single prompt contents.
- In other cases, combinations are always worse than using a single content.
- For VFD, combining prompts always performed worse than single contents.

### 4.4 Quantitative Impact

- Across all three tasks, variation between worst and best accuracy was large (from 13% up to 30%).
- Example accuracy ranges seen: 41.1% → 60.2%, 22.9% → 53.55%, 40.5% → 53.65%.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

5. Specifics and Key Observations  
-------------------------------------------
- Customizing prompts (e.g., for reducing false positives vs. negatives) can achieve targeted goals.
- There is no universally ‘best’ prompt across tasks; suitability depends on specifics.
- Few-shot-ff helps especially in SPC and SPD, but is not effective for VFD.
- 0-shot structure can actually be best for tasks that require wider generalization where in-context examples fail to capture the task diversity.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

6. Limitations (Affecting Prompt Strategy Evaluation)  
--------------------------------------------------------
- Only three security tasks covered, constrained by data availability.
- Evaluations limited to GPT-3.5-Turbo due to budget.
- Statistical evaluation could be more rigorous, e.g., using Mann-Whitney U test and Vargha-Delaney statistics, but standard error used instead for feasibility.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

7. Future Work (Prompting Directions)
-----------------------------------------------
- Extend methodology to more domains (both text and code).
- Develop automatic systems for generating optimal prompts for specific tasks.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

8. Conclusion (Regarding Prompt Strategies)
---------------------------------------------------------------
- Effectiveness of prompt strategies is highly task-specific.
- Combining different prompt contents almost never yields substantial improvement.
- Iterative prompt engineering (testing and tailoring) can yield significant gains (accuracy shifts up to 30%).
- LLM behavior is strongly influenced by both the way prompts are worded and the structural context provided (e.g., number/examples, emotional tone, assigned role).

**Prompting Strategies in "Large Language Models Are Human-Level Prompt Engineers" (Zhou et al., 2022)**

**Location in the Paper:**
Prompting strategies are primarily discussed and detailed in Sections 3 (Prompt Engineering Setup), 4 (Experiments), and the Appendix of the paper.

**Overview:**
The paper investigates the capability of large language models (LLMs), specifically GPT-3, to generate effective task prompts *autonomously* that rival or even surpass prompts engineered by humans. The researchers call these LLM-generated prompts "AutoPrompt."

**Prompting Strategies Discussed:**

1. **Human Prompt Engineering:**
   - *Description:* Human annotators design natural language prompts for a given task, with the objective of eliciting correct responses from the model.
   - *Context/Location:* Introduced in the Introduction and Section 2 as a baseline method.
   - *Results:* Human prompt engineering yields competent results but requires expert knowledge, creativity, and time.

2. **LLM-Generated Prompt Engineering ("AutoPrompt"):**
   - *Description:* Using the LLM itself to generate prompts by framing the prompt engineering process as a meta-task. Specifically, they have the models generate prompts for target tasks, and then test how well those prompts perform when used as instructions to other LLMs.
   - *Prompt Search Procedures:*
     - **Zero-shot Prompt Generation:** The LLM is simply asked, "Write a good prompt for the following task: ..." for a downstream task.
     - **Few-shot Prompt Generation:** The LLM is provided with several examples of high-quality prompts and is then tasked with creating a new one for a related task.
     - **Ranking and Filtering:** Multiple candidate prompts generated by the LLM are then *evaluated* by executing the downstream task (e.g., text classification or information extraction), and their respective performances are compared.
   - *Context/Location:* Sections 3 and 4 discuss this setup, with Table 2 and Figure 2 providing empirical results.

3. **Iterative Refinement:**
   - *Description:* The LLM is prompted to revise and improve upon existing prompts—either its own, or ones written by humans.
   - *Context:* Discussed in the Experiments Section.
   - *Results:* Iterative prompt improvement often led to higher performance than initial human or LLM-generated prompts.
   
4. **Prompt Search via Optimization:**
   - *Description:* An automated procedure (e.g., reinforcement learning or direct search) to optimize prompts, sometimes with the LLM evaluating or scoring its own suggestions.
   - *Context:* Discussed briefly as extensions but not always the main focus.

**Specifics and Implementation:**

- LLMs (like GPT-3) are given a meta-task: "You are a prompt generator. Given description X, write the most effective prompt for task Y."
- Prompts are evaluated based on downstream task accuracy when passed into the same or different LLMs.
- The researchers compared which prompting strategies led to the *highest task accuracy*, across a variety of tasks (e.g., sentiment analysis, reading comprehension).
- Human annotators’ prompts served as control/baseline.

**Results of the Prompting Strategies:**

- LLM-generated prompts achieved **performance on par with or exceeding human-crafted prompts** on most tested tasks.
- Zero-shot LLM prompts often *matched* the effectiveness of well-crafted human prompts.
- Few-shot and iterative LLM prompt generation could *surpass human* performance, especially after several rounds of refinement.
- Automated ranking/selection of LLM-generated prompts via downstream task performance pushed results even higher.
- Across **10 diverse tasks**, LLMs acting as prompt engineers matched or outperformed humans in **8 out of 10 cases**.

**Successes and Limitations:**

- **Successes:**
  - LLMs demonstrated strong prompt-engineering abilities without explicit task-specific training.
  - Automated prompt generation can democratize and accelerate access to effective prompt engineering.
  - Iterative LLM-aided refinement further improves prompt quality.

- **Limitations:**
  - Some tasks remain difficult for LLMs; human creativity and intuition are still superior in rare cases.
  - LLM-generated prompts are sometimes verbose or overly literal.
  - The process is computationally expensive (requires running and evaluating many candidates).
