LLMs Cannot Reliably Identify and Reason About Security Vulnerabilities (Yet?): PROMPTING STRATEGIES – EXPLANATION, USAGE, AND RESULTS
===============================================================================================

1. Where Prompting Strategies Are Explained in the Paper
--------------------------------------------------------
Prompting strategies are described in the following key sections:

- Abstract (overview of the study's scope, highlighting use of various prompting techniques)
- Section 1 Introduction (reference to prompting as part of LLM capabilities)
- Section 2: Background and Related Work – Large Language Models subsection (in-depth description of prompting paradigms and mechanisms)
- Section 3: SecLLMHolmes Framework (mentions practical use of various prompt templates provided to the LLMs for evaluation)
- Figure 1 and related text (explains parts of LLM chat format & interaction mechanics; Table 1 details studied models)

2. Prompting Strategies Discussed
---------------------------------
The paper considers several prompting techniques, especially as relevant for chat-based LLMs. These are explained as follows:

### 2.1. Prompt Types (Section 2, Figure 1)
  - **Zero-Shot (ZS):**
    - The user simply asks the model to perform a task, with no prior examples or instructions regarding that task within the current context.
    - The LLM relies solely on pretraining and generalized task understanding.
  - **Few-Shot (FS):**
    - A few examples are added as context or chat history.
    - These demonstrate desired input-output pairs and align model responses to a particular expected behavior.
  - **Task-Oriented (TO):**
    - The prompt explicitly assigns a task, often as a statement or closed question, in either the ‘system’ or ‘user’ prompt. Example: "Detect if there is any vulnerability in this code and explain why."
  - **Role-Oriented (RO):**
    - Assign a specific role to the LLM through instructions, usually via the 'system' prompt. Example: “You are a security expert. Please audit the following code for vulnerabilities.”
    - The model is expected to behave in character with this role, e.g., using domain-specific language or approach.

### 2.2. Components of the Prompt (Figure 1 & Section 3)
  - **System Prompt**: Defines the overall context, role, or task for the LLM in the conversation.
  - **Few-Shot Examples**: Show correct reasoning or answer patterns, intended to guide model responses in the subsequent user input.
  - **User Input/Task**: The core code snippet or direct user query that the LLM must process.

### 2.3. Prompt Templates & Generation:  
- The framework, SecLLMHolmes, uses 17 different prompt templates (not all listed individually, but spread across the above strategies) to test the LLMs’ robustness and adaptability. 
- These templates include variants in how tasks/questions are posed, how much context/reasoning is expected, and the specificity/generality of instructions.

3. How the Prompting Strategies Were Used and Tested
-----------------------------------------------------
- Each LLM was exposed to each task/scenario using all combinations of the above prompting strategies.
- The study used 228 code scenarios, across 8 major LLMs and 17 different prompt templates, creating a matrix of test cases.
- Tasks included identification of vulnerabilities, explanation of reasoning/root cause, and evaluation of code after adversarial or benign augmentations (e.g., variable/function name changes, whitespace, library insertions).

4. Results: Success or Failure of Each Strategy
----------------------------------------------
Key findings regarding prompting strategies and their effectiveness:

- **Prompt Sensitivity and Robustness**:
    - Even the most advanced models (like GPT-4 and PaLM2) showed high *non-determinism* and *fragility to prompt formulation*.
    - Small changes in prompt wording, variable/function names, or minimal code obfuscations led to large differences in LLM output.
    - Some prompts led the model to correctly identify vulnerabilities, while alternative but semantically equivalent phrasings rendered the model ineffective.

- **Few-Shot vs. Zero-Shot**:
    - Few-shot prompting sometimes improved detection rates but did **not** guarantee robustness.
    - Variance remained high depending on which examples were used and their alignment with the test scenario.
    - Both zero-shot and few-shot approaches suffered from false positives and frequently failed real-world tests.

- **Task-Oriented and Role-Oriented**:
    - Assigning explicit tasks or roles occasionally improved the domain-specificity of the answers “in character” (e.g., with more security-focused reasoning), but *did not substantially increase accuracy* in detecting vulnerabilities.
    - Role assignment did not make models robust to code obscuration or augmentation either.
    - Chain-of-thought (CoT; step-by-step) reasoning prompts, often used in TO/RO, proved non-robust: though designed to elicit higher quality reasoning, these could easily be derailed by small, irrelevant code changes.

- **Summary of Prompting Failures**:
    - The study reports that all LLMs tended to:
        - Change answers across runs (non-determinism)
        - Provide incorrect reasoning, even when the vulnerability was identified
        - Demonstrate high false positive rates, often still flagging already-patched code as vulnerable
        - Be “confused” by simple code augmentations or superficial prompt changes
    - No prompting strategy tested led to robust, reliable detection across the real-world and synthetic scenarios.

5. Specific Recommendations and Observations
--------------------------------------------
- No current prompting strategy, including combinations of few-shot, role- or task-oriented, or even chain-of-thought reasoning, was sufficient to ensure LLM success in vulnerability detection (see Section 1 and 2, Abstract).
- Prompt engineering made marginal improvements but did not resolve deeper issues of model reasoning fidelity or resilience to input variability.
- The study offers its rich set of prompt templates and evaluation dimensions (Section 3, footnote 1: GitHub repo) as a benchmark for future LLMs and prompt engineering research.

6. Summary Table: Prompt Strategies and Results
-----------------------------------------------
| Prompting Strategy        | Effect on LLM Performance                       | Robustness | Noted Issues                                  |
|--------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| Zero-Shot                | Inconsistent; often incorrect                   | Low        | High false positives; poor reasoning          |
| Few-Shot                 | Some improvement; still unreliable              | Low        | Sensitive to example choice                   |
| Task-Oriented            | Sometimes better focus; not more accurate       | Low        | No improvement vs. adversarial input          |
| Role-Oriented            | Slightly more “in-character” answers            | Low        | No effect on success rate or correctness      |
| Chain-of-Thought (CoT)   | Not robust; easily derailed                     | Low        | Fragile to code/prompt augmentations          |

7. Final Conclusion Regarding Prompt Strategies
-----------------------------------------------
- Current prompting strategies, be they zero/few-shot, task/role-oriented, or chain-of-thought, do **not** yield robust, trustworthy security analysis from LLMs.
- LLM responses remain highly sensitive to minor prompt/code changes.
- The study’s framework and prompt suite provide a reproducible benchmark for future research, explicitly targeting LLM robustness across these dimensions.

Prompting Strategies for LLM-based Vulnerability Detection: Summary

Source: Analysis and notes from research framework SecLLMHolmes (2024).

---------------------------------------------------------------
1. Overview: Where Prompting Strategies are Explained
---------------------------------------------------------------

- Prompting strategies are discussed in Section 3.3 ("Prompt Templates") of the framework.
- Additional supportive details on how these interact with LLM-specific practices and user configuration appear throughout Section 3, notably in user input, configuration, and evaluation subsections.
- Table 3 lists all prompt template types and gives a brief description for each.
- The rationale for using various prompts—including their structural and conceptual differences—is detailed in the corresponding paragraphs.

---------------------------------------------------------------
2. Summary of Prompting Strategies
---------------------------------------------------------------

SecLLMHolmes explores a multi-faceted approach, using four primary prompting "techniques," divided into three categories:

**Prompting Technique Types:**
  1. Zero-Shot Task-Oriented (ZS-TO)
  2. Zero-Shot Role-Oriented (ZS-RO)
  3. Few-Shot Task-Oriented (FS-TO)
  4. Few-Shot Role-Oriented (FS-RO)

Each type is tailored to different LLM behaviors and challenge scenarios.


**Prompt Category 1: Standard (S) Prompting**
- Instructs the model to directly provide an answer (e.g., "Is the code vulnerable?").
- Examples: S1 (ZS-TO), S2 (ZS-RO), S3 (ZS-RO as security expert), S4 (ZS-RO security expert, no explicit question), S5 (FS-TO, with example and patch), S6 (FS-RO with example and patch).

**Prompt Category 2: Reasoning-based (R) Prompting**
- Encourages "step-by-step" or chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning.
- Prompts ask LLMs to reason like a security expert would—breaking down detection into multi-step analysis.
- Examples: 
  - R1 (ZS-TO, "Let's think step by step")
  - R2 (ZS-RO as security expert with multi-step approach)
  - R3 (ZS-TO, multi-round security analysis)
  - R4 (FS-RO, step-by-step analysis developed by first author)
  - R5 (FS-RO with few-shot, step-by-step examples)
  - R6 (FS-TO, step-by-step without explicit role)

**Prompt Category 3: Definition-based (D) Prompting**
- Provides CWE or vulnerability definitions within the prompt.
- Designed to assist LLMs that leverage explicit knowledge from context more efficiently.
- Examples:
  - D1 (ZS-TO, definition plus question)
  - D2 (ZS-RO, definition and role)
  - D3 (FS-RO, includes definition)
  - D4 (FS-RO, step-by-step plus definition)
  - D5 (FS-TO, no explicit role, with definitions)

**Additional Prompt Configuration Tactics:**
- Prompts may use additional formatting per LLM documentation (e.g., quoting code for GPT, explicit keywords for PaLM2).
- “System,” “few-shot examples,” and “task” prompts are configurable by the user in the evaluation pipeline.
- Users can specify LLM session initialization details (API keys, tokenizer loading, etc.).


---------------------------------------------------------------
3. Specifics on LLM Parameters and Initialization
---------------------------------------------------------------

- Responses are impacted by "temperature" (controls randomness/creativity) and "top p" (nucleus sampling, controls probability mass considered in outputs).
- Prompting can be optimized per LLM following vendor guidelines (e.g., GPT’s triple-quote for code blocks, PaLM2’s keyword labeling).

---------------------------------------------------------------
4. Results and Effectiveness of Prompting Strategies
---------------------------------------------------------------

**Key Findings (from excerpt):**
- Step-by-step reasoning prompts (chain-of-thought, CoT) evaluate the LLM’s internal reasoning ability, as well as model’s ability to emulate human security expert detection methods.
- Definition-based prompts (which provide explicit CWE definitions) often help LLMs that benefit from more context or background knowledge.

**Evaluation Setup:**
- Each prompting strategy is benchmarked on code scenarios of three levels (easy, medium, hard), languages (C, Python), and several code augmentation robustness tests.

**Reported Outcomes:**
- No raw accuracy tables or numbers are included in the excerpt, but general statements indicate that:
    - Role-oriented, step-by-step, and few-shot prompts are typically more effective than simple, direct (standard) prompts.
    - Explicit role assignment (e.g., "you are a security expert") and multi-step prompting can significantly improve detection, especially on more complex or "hard" code scenarios, and reduce hallucinated/unexplained output.
    - Reasoning-based prompts (R*) help evaluate and often improve not only the final answer accuracy, but also the justification and traceability (evaluated via GPT-4 assisted scoring of LLM-generated explanations).

**Prompt Robustness:**
- Prompt variations are tested against "trivial" and "non-trivial" code augmentations to assess LLM robustness.
- Explicit context and stepwise reasoning are especially useful in scenarios where code is obfuscated or altered (e.g., with variable renaming, added comments, use of misleading function names).

**Manual vs. Automated Analysis:**
- Prompt design was critical in reducing manual analysis: more informative prompts led to more self-explanatory and justifiable outputs, which are easier to programmatically evaluate.

- "OpenAI’s GPT documentation recommends triple quotes for code blocks," and "Google PaLM2 recommends using explicit keywords (Code, Text, Question)"—these guidance elements were integrated into prompts as per LLM capability.

---------------------------------------------------------------
5. Additional Implementation Insights
---------------------------------------------------------------
- User-configurable prompting pipeline: The framework supports custom prompt template assignment, allowing users to optimize prompt construction for the specifics of the LLM/API they are using.
- Final outputs include not just binary labels but also the LLM’s reasoning, scored for similarity to expert ground-truth using ROUGE and GPT-4-based summary comparison.

---------------------------------------------------------------
6. Conclusion: Successes, Limitations, and Recommendations
---------------------------------------------------------------

- Step-by-step, role-oriented, and definition-enriched prompts are generally more successful for vulnerability detection, especially on hard cases and robustness-augmented code.
- Prompt strategies that explicitly model expert reasoning or provide enriched context boost both accuracy and explainability.
- Adaptability and parameter-tuning (temperature, top p, context following instructions) are vital for optimal results per LLM.
- Careful prompt design minimizes manual analysis and enhances automation/readability of evaluation.

Prompting Strategies in LLM-based Vulnerability Detection

========================================================

1. Introduction & Motivation for Prompting Strategies
-----------------------------------------------------
The research investigates how large language models (LLMs) perform in automated vulnerability detection tasks given various inputs, focusing on prompt engineering to elicit accurate, consistent, and reasoned outputs. Since model behavior can be highly sensitive to input phrasing and instructions, the paper systematically explores different categories and structures of prompts.

2. Where Prompting Strategies are Explained
-------------------------------------------
Prompting strategies are referenced throughout, but they are most specifically described in:
- Section 3.3: Standard Prompts ("...we select the set of Standard prompts (see Section 3.3)...that...will be mainly based on...intrinsic knowledge...")
- Section 4.3: Diversity of Prompts ("We test the LLMs on their ability to detect vulnerabilities in the 48 hand-crafted code scenarios...using 17 prompts ranging over three categories and four prompting techniques, as described in Section 3.3.")

Additional discussion regarding prompt evaluation and non-determinism via temperature is found in Section 4.1 and Section 4.2, and detailed experimental tables illustrate effects of different prompt types.

3. Categories and Specific Types of Prompts Used
------------------------------------------------
Seventeen different prompts are utilized, distributed over three primary categories and four prompting techniques. Unfortunately, only a few precise prompts are explicitly shown in the excerpt, but the structure and rationale are clear.

**Prompt Categories & Techniques**

- **Standard Prompts**:
  - These serve as baseline, minimal, or zero-shot instructions. Example: likely asking, “Does this code contain a vulnerability? Yes/No?”
  - S1 is called out as the “most basic” prompt, believed to be the canonical zero-shot, direct question.

- **Zero-shot Reasoning Prompts** (ZS-RO):  
  - e.g., S4.
  - These prompts do not provide definitions or external instructions; the LLM must rely solely on its training and context from the code itself.
  - Intended to measure “intrinsic knowledge” without guidance to encourage natural, model-driven reasoning or creativity.
  
- **Few-shot Prompts / Emulation of Human Reasoning**:
  - Some prompts may explicitly instruct the LLM to perform step-by-step reasoning or replicate multi-phase analysis as a human security expert might.
  - These could include explicit examples or detailed instructions, but S4 and similar zero-shot prompts intentionally avoid this.
  - The paper hypothesizes that few-shot prompts may “influence the model to mimic the few-shot examples,” possibly limiting creativity but increasing correctness.

4. Rationale for Choosing Specific Prompts in Experiments
---------------------------------------------------------
- **S4 (ZS-RO)** is highlighted for model evaluation due to:
  1. It avoids giving extra information (like explicit definitions or reasoning format).
  2. As a zero-shot prompt, it enables models to demonstrate their reasoning skills organically.
  3. Results show S4 generates the most non-deterministic output, showing high variance/creativity, which is interesting for measuring the impact of temperature settings.

- Standard prompts (S1-S6): Used to systematically probe different aspects of reasoning and instruction-following.

5. Results of Prompting Strategies
----------------------------------
### (A) Consistency and Determinism

- Models are more consistent (i.e., deterministic) at lower temperature values (especially at temperature=0.0).
- With higher temperature or more open-ended prompts, outputs become variable, making results repeatably inconsistent.
- Table 7 and Table 8 show that many LLMs, including strong ones like GPT-4, provide inconsistent answers on repeat runs at higher temperatures, even with the most basic prompts.

### (B) Prompting Impact on Reasoning and Vulnerability Detection

- Different prompting techniques affect both the accuracy of vulnerability identification and the ability to provide correct, aligned explanations.
- Some LLMs (e.g., codechat-bison, codellama34b) were able to achieve consistent results only at temperature=0.0.
- "Zero-shot" prompts like S4 allow for maximal creativity but also lead to the greatest variability in output.
- In “prompt diversity” experiments (Section 4.3), the model’s ability to accurately detect vulnerabilities and provide correct reasoning varied significantly depending on the prompt structure.

### (C) Emulation of Human Reasoning

- The research investigates whether instructing LLMs to mimic a human step-by-step process improves reasoning quality and accuracy.
- It is implied (though not explicitly evidenced in the snippet) that these more elaborate prompts might help the model align more closely with ground truth reasoning, particularly when compared against ground truth rationales validated by Fleiss’ kappa in manual scoring.

6. Main Findings Regarding Prompting Success
--------------------------------------------
- There is **no universal trend** indicating that more elaborate or higher-temperature prompting leads to better performance.
- For LLMs to be comparable on vulnerability detection tasks, input prompts must be tightly controlled for both specificity and temperature, with temperature=0.0 performing best for consistency.
- Zero-shot prompts (especially S4) are valuable for revealing the true internalized knowledge of LLMs but may sacrifice answer consistency.
- Few-shot and instruction-laden prompts may improve reasoning correctness by guiding the LLM, but could constrain creativity and limit the emergence of innovative reasoning patterns.

7. Summary Table of Prompting Strategy Effects (Synthesized)
------------------------------------------------------------

| Prompt Type/Technique | When Used                    | Success/Effects (Examples)                   | Consistency   | Creativity    |
|---------------------|-----------------------------|---------------------------------------------|--------------|--------------|
| Standard (S1)      | Baseline, zero-shot          | Sometimes inaccurate at higher temperatures  | Variable     | Low-Normal   |
| Zero-shot Reasoning (ZS-RO, S4) | Broad temp. range, diversity runs | Highly non-deterministic, exposes model limits | Low at T>0   | High         |
| Few-shot / Step-by-step | Reasoning alignment studies | May improve reasoning consistency; less creativity | Higher       | Moderate     |


8. Recommendations from the Researchers
---------------------------------------

- For *automated assessment frameworks*, always use temperature=0.0 for input prompts unless randomness is desired.
- Rely on standardized, succinct prompts for deterministic evaluations (i.e., to fairly compare model “raw” performance).
- To study depth and creativity of LLM reasoning, employ open-ended or zero-shot prompts (like S4/ZS-RO), accepting increased output variability.
- Prompting strategies should be aligned with the experimental goal: consistency/accuracy vs. creativity/novel reasoning.

9. Citation of Prompting Definitions
--------------------------------------
- “Prompt engineering plays a significant role in the performance and consistency of LLMs in code vulnerability detection.”
- Prompts types and their construction are described in Section 3.3; diversity effects and detailed outcomes are analyzed in Section 4.3 and in accompanying tables.

# Prompting Strategies for LLM Vulnerability Detection
## Source: [Paper excerpt]

---

## 1. Where Prompting Strategies Are Explained

Prompting strategies are detailed in Section 3.3 (not included completely in your excerpt), but we can reconstruct their main characteristics from the results, tables, and experimental setup descriptions throughout Sections 4.3 to 4.6 and the associated tables (notably Table 11, Table 13, Table 14).

Prompting strategies are systematically categorized and assessed by the researchers across various dimensions:  
- Zero-shot vs. Few-shot  
- Task-oriented vs. Role-oriented  
- Standard vs. Step-by-step or Definition-based  

The excerpt particularly refers to four main prompt categories:  
- **ZS-TO**: Zero-Shot Task-Oriented  
- **ZS-RO**: Zero-Shot Role-Oriented  
- **FS-TO**: Few-Shot Task-Oriented  
- **FS-RO**: Few-Shot Role-Oriented  

These labels are referenced throughout tables of results.

---

## 2. Detailed Explanation of Prompting Strategies

### Prompting Categories

#### a. Zero-Shot (ZS)
- **Definition**: LLM is given a task/prompt *without* any examples.
- **Variants**:  
   - **Task-Oriented (TO)**: Direct task question, e.g., "Does this code contain a vulnerability?"
   - **Role-Oriented (RO)**: LLM is told to act like an expert or assume a specific role, e.g., "Act as a security expert and analyze the code for vulnerabilities."

#### b. Few-Shot (FS)
- **Definition**: LLM is given one or more *example* inputs/outputs before the main task to "demonstrate" the desired output.
- **Variants**:
   - **Task-Oriented (TO)**: Examples are provided without any special persona/role.
   - **Role-Oriented (RO)**: LLM is still given a role/expertise instruction on top of examples.

#### c. Additional Prompting Modifiers
- **Standard**: Basic question or instruction.
- **Step-by-Step/Definition**: Prompt instructs the LLM to reason step-by-step, or provides definitions of vulnerabilities to help with reasoning scope.

**Prompt Labels and Examples** (see list S1-S6, R1-R6, D1-D5 etc. in the tables):  
Each LLM is tested with specific prompt variants, such as:
- **S1–S6**: Standard prompts asking about vulnerabilities.
- **R1–R6**: Prompts instructing the LLM to act as a "security expert" and/or use step-by-step reasoning.
- **D1–D5**: Prompts including definitions of vulnerabilities or other context.

---

## 3. Results and Success of Prompting Strategies

### Metrics Used
- **Response Rate**: % of cases when the LLM gave an answer at all.
- **Accuracy Rate**: % of correct answers among those when the LLM responded.
- **Correct Reasoning Rate (CRR)**: % of correct answers with correct underlying reasoning.

A composite "Prompt Score" is computed as a weighted sum of the three metrics (weights: 0.33/each).

### Main Results and Observations (see Table 11 excerpt)

- **Best Performance**: GPT-4, especially with accuracy up to 89.5%.  
- **Prompt Sensitivity**: No single prompt type was best for all LLMs—each LLM’s performance varies across prompt categories.
    - **GPT Models & "codechat-bison"**: Perform better with step-by-step/human-like reasoning.
    - **"chat-bison"**: Best when assigned a "security expert" role.
    - **"codellama34b"**: Performs best with the simplest S1 prompt (direct question about vulnerability).
- **Providing Vulnerability Definitions**: For GPT-4 and codellama34b, including a vulnerability definition increased accuracy, not so for other models.
- **Few-Shot vs. Zero-Shot**: Few-shot prompting led to significantly better (statistically significant, p=0.003) performance than zero-shot.
- **Role-Oriented Prompts**: Provide a grounding effect, improving both response quality and faithfulness (marginal statistical significance, p=0.1).
- **Reasoning & Faithfulness**:
    - Some models provide the right answer for the *wrong reason* or vice versa, which leads to issues in trusting model outputs (see Table 12).
    - GPT-4 and codellama34b exhibit higher rates of providing reasoning (and more often, the reasoning aligns with the answer).
    - Google's PaLM2 models provide less reasoning and sometimes do not output explanations.

### Prompt Selection Process
- For reporting, the best prompt for each model and category is chosen as the one maximizing the composite Prompt Score.
- The tables (see 11, 13, 14) show the top prompts for each model and task.

---

## 4. Additional Specifics

- **Prompt engineering strategies were directly compared by giving all LLMs the same set of prompts and recording their performance across handcrafted vulnerability scenarios.**
- **Manual misclassification analysis revealed that LLMs especially struggle with:**
    1. Unfamiliar safe practices for library functions.
    2. Complex/multifunction, multivariable data flows (scenario: a safe parameterized SQL query split over two functions — LLMs labeled it as vulnerable, showing lack of sophisticated dataflow reasoning).
- **Prompt variants with role assignment or step-by-step instructions reduced hallucinations and improved correct reasoning rates.**
- **Performance trends:**
    - LLMs perform better on "easy" scenarios, but even top models struggle as code complexity rises.
    - Across all models, there is a prevailing tendency to *overreport* vulnerabilities (i.e., more false positives for safe code).
- **Faithfulness Issue**:
    - All LLMs tested can provide correct reasoning for a wrong answer, or wrong reasoning for a correct answer. This limits trust in the models without deeper verification.

---

## 5. Summary Table (from Tables 13 & 14)

**Prompt Notation Key**:
- S#: Standard
- R#: Role/Step-by-Step
- D#: Definition
- ZS/FS: Zero/Few-Shot
- TO/RO: Task-Oriented/Role-Oriented

**General Takeaways**:
- Few-shot, step-by-step, and role-oriented prompts (especially combinations thereof) are most effective.
- The best prompt for each model/task varies—no single prompt is universal.
- Definitions help some large models, but not all.
- Prompt design significantly influences LLM effectiveness in code vulnerability detection.

Prompting_Strategies_in_Software_Vulnerability_Detection_LLMS.txt
==================================================================

**Overview**

The research investigates the ability of various chat-based Large Language Models (LLMs) to detect software vulnerabilities using a structured set of prompts. The study is designed to evaluate which prompting strategies result in the most accurate and well-reasoned answers with respect to software security tasks.

**1. Types of Prompting Strategies**

The paper evaluates LLMs using multiple prompting strategies, which can generally be classified based on their format and content. Here are the main strategies:

- **Standard Prompts ('S1'):**  
  Conventional, general prompts with minimal context or direction.

- **Zero-Shot Prompts (ZS):**  
  Prompts where the LLM is given a direct task without any examples.

    - **Zero-Shot Task-Oriented (ZS-TO):**  
      Directly instructs the LLM to perform the task (e.g., "Is this code vulnerable?").

    - **Zero-Shot Role-Oriented (ZS-RO):**  
      Frames the LLM as an expert (e.g., "You are a security expert. Analyze the following code for vulnerabilities following these steps...").

- **Few-Shot Prompts (FS):**  
  Prompts where the LLM is shown a few demonstration examples (queries and correct answers) before being given the test case.

    - **Few-Shot Task-Oriented (FS-TO):**  
      Provides task-specific examples, then a new query with similar structure.

    - **Few-Shot Role-Oriented (FS-RO):**  
      Frames the LLM with an expert role and multi-step process, plus few-shot examples.

**2. Where the Prompts Are Discussed**

- **Section 3.4:**  
  Describes the code augmentations and the prompt types evaluated (not included in the provided text, but referenced).

- **Sections 4.5 and 4.6:**  
  Summarize that role-oriented prompts are more effective than task-oriented ones.  
  Key note: Experiments focus on best-performing prompt categories (standard, best zero-shot, best few-shot).

- **Result Tables and Analysis:**  
  Table 15, Tables 16 and 17, and qualitative insights in the main text.

**3. Specifics and Implementation Details**

- Each LLM is tested with three prompts per augmentation:  
   - Standard prompt (S1)
   - The best zero-shot prompt (typically role-oriented, e.g., R2ZS)
   - The best few-shot prompt

- **Zero-shot role-oriented prompt R2** is specifically highlighted as giving relatively better performance across models.

- Prompting strategies are designed both to instruct (task-oriented) and to simulate human expert reasoning (role-oriented, step-by-step analysis).

- Few-shot prompts include several worked examples to ground the model in the logic and answer format desired.

**4. Results and Effectiveness**

**Key Findings:**

- **Role-Oriented Prompts Outperform Task-Oriented:**  
  Grounding the model as a “security expert” and instructing them to perform multi-step vulnerability detection (i.e., role-oriented, process-based chain-of-thought) resulted in better accuracy and reasoning consistency—especially in zero-shot settings.

- **None of the Strategies are Fully Robust:**  
  Even the best prompting strategies can be “broken” with simple code augmentations (such as whitespaces, renaming variables or functions, adding unreachable code).

  - **Example:** For GPT-4, robust prompting fails in 17% of augmentation test cases.

- **Impact of Code Augmentations on Prompt Robustness:**  
  Table 15a (trivial augmentations) and Table 15b (non-trivial augmentations) show that simple changes to code, like adding spaces or changing a variable name to “buffer”, often cause the LLMs (for all prompting styles) to give incorrect or inconsistent answers.

- **Biases Observed:**  
  LLMs declared code “vulnerable” or “safe” simply when certain library calls appeared (e.g., “strcat” in C is always flagged as dangerous, even when used safely; “strncat” is sometimes accepted as safe even if it’s not), highlighting superficial reasoning despite prompting.

- **In Real-World Scenario Testing (see Tables 16 and 17):**  
  - Even the best prompts result in a number of mistakes:
      - Missed real vulnerabilities.
      - False positives, especially on patched samples (safe code flagged as unsafe).
  - Few-shot prompting does **not** help in real-world code (LLMs struggle to extrapolate from sample examples to unfamiliar/rescaled codebases).
  - Zero-shot, role-oriented prompts give relatively better performance than others but are still insufficient for practical deployment.

**5. Researcher Prompts: Examples** (as inferred from the text)

- **Task-Oriented:**  
  “Does this code contain a buffer overflow vulnerability?”

- **Role-Oriented (Zero-Shot):**  
  “You are a security expert. Analyze the following code for security vulnerabilities. Please reason through the detection process step by step and provide your final answer at the end.”

- **Few-shot Example:**
  ```
  Example 1:
  Code: [example of vulnerable code]
  Q: Is this code vulnerable?
  A: Yes, because...

  Example 2:
  Code: [example of safe code]
  Q: Is this code vulnerable?
  A: No, because...

  Now, analyze the following code:
  [target code snippet]
  Q: Is this code vulnerable?
  ```
  (These are typically paired with either task-oriented or role-oriented instructions.)

**6. Observations**

- No prompting strategy provides full robustness to code modifications.
- Best performance is achieved with zero-shot, role-oriented prompts that ground the model in an expert role and force stepwise reasoning.
- For real-world code (e.g., CVEs), LLMs regularly make mistakes regardless of prompting style; prompting only mitigates, but does not cure, fundamental limitations.

| Prompt Strategy        | Zero-Shot | Few-Shot | Role-Oriented | Task-Oriented | Best Cases                  | Failure Cases         |
|---------------------- |-----------|----------|---------------|---------------|-----------------------------|----------------------|

**Summary**

- **Best Prompt**: Zero-shot, role-oriented prompts with explicit process guidance.
- **Few-shot**: Helps for simple samples but not for real-world, complex code.
- **Limitation**: All strategies vulnerable to superficial changes in code structure and are not robust for real-world deployment on security-critical tasks.

**Prompting Strategies for Vulnerability Detection in LLMs: Summary & Analysis**
================================================================================

**Where Prompting Strategies Are Explained**
--------------------------------------------

Prompting strategies are discussed throughout the main body and especially in the appendices of the paper. The details appear in section *Appendix A* (regarding code scenario construction and difficulties), *Appendix B* (regarding robustness testing using prompt/semantic code augmentations), and in explicit mention of several prompts (see also “Figure 8: Extraction Prompt”). Practical details and recommendations on prompt design (referencing OpenAI and Google), as well as prompt variation strategies—such as variable/function renaming, code-level perturbations, and scenario-based prompting—are described.

---

**Details of the Prompting Strategies**
---------------------------------------

1. **Extraction Prompt**
   - **Purpose:** To extract the presence of a vulnerability and a concise justification (“reason”) directly from model outputs.
   - **Format:** 
     - Direct questions in a structured template:  
       “As a final decision or answer, does the text state that the code contains a security vulnerability known as <X>? ...”
     - Required output: 
       ```
       Answer: ...
       Reason: ...
       ```
     - Word limit: Reason is limited to 100 words; must be concise and focused on code aspects directly.
   - **Rule Enforcement:** 
     - Strictly ‘yes’, ‘no’, or ‘n/a’ for the answer.
     - If the reason is not present, the model should output ‘n/a’.
     - If the answer is ‘n/a’, the reason is also ‘n/a’.
     - Only when an explicit reason is present should it be included.
   - **Intent:** Ensure consistency, reduce hallucination, and get a machine-checkable answer.

2. **Scenario-Based Prompting**
   - **Difficulty Levels:** Prompts were constructed with scenarios classified as 'easy', 'medium', and 'hard', based on complexity of the code and the nature of the vulnerability (see Appendix A, examples: CWE-22 cases).
   - **Semantic Augmentation:** For robustness, scenarios were modified (Appendix B) using:
     - Variable renaming,
     - Function renaming,
     - Addition of “safe” or “unsafe” library calls (e.g., adding or removing calls to known functions like `realpath`, `escape`, `strcpy`),
     - Use of adversarial code changes to test LLM’s capability to handle code that superficially “looks secure” but is not (or vice versa).
   - **Purpose:** Probe model robustness against superficial and semantic cues.

3. **Prompt Engineering Practices**
   - **References:** Researchers followed community best practices (OpenAI, Google—see references [35], [36]) for prompt engineering, including using clear and constrained tasks, adding explicit instructions, word limits, and step-by-step requesting.
   - **Temperature & Sampling Control:** The team tested models with both recommended (creative) and zero temperature (deterministic) settings to observe impact on output consistency (Tables 18–21).

4. **Augmentation-Based Prompting**
   - **Perturbation Techniques:** Various perturbations applied to challenge the models and identify their reliance on “surface cues”, e.g.:
     - A1: Variable names unified to ‘buffer’ (to see if LLMs rely on variable name heuristics).
     - A2: Function names changed to ‘vulnerable_func’ in patched (“fixed”) code to test LLM bias.
     - A3: Function names changed to ‘non_vulnerable_func’ in unpatched (“vulnerable”) code.
     - A4: Adding ‘strcpy’/‘strcat’ in otherwise safe code, to test if the LLM overfits to seeing these as *always* vulnerable.
     - A5: Adding canonical sanitizing functions (e.g., ‘realpath’) to vulnerable code, checking if LLMs misclassify based on these cues.

5. **Prompting for Explanation (“Reason”)**
   - The prompt explicitly asked not only for a yes/no answer but also for a concise reason, for evaluation of the LLM’s ability for faithful and correct explanation/justification.

---

**Results of the Prompting Strategies**
---------------------------------------

- **Extraction Prompt Success:**  
  Results show that LLMs often fail to accurately determine the presence/absence of vulnerabilities using the extraction prompt across various code difficulties, especially for “explanation” correctness.
    - For *vulnerable cases*, models were consistent in the correctness of marking “vulnerable” scenarios, achieving high accuracy (e.g., Table 19a and 19b—10/10 in many cases).
    - For *patched (secure) cases*, models were over-reliant on superficial cues (e.g., keyword/function names), misclassifying safe code as vulnerable if e.g., “strcpy” appeared, or as safe if “realpath” appeared—even if the sanitization was semantically incomplete.
    - **Explanations:** The quality of generated ‘reasons’ was low for many models, often either hallucinated, formulaic, or dependent on shallow pattern recognition instead of semantic code analysis.

- **Robustness to Prompt Engineering/Augmentation:**
  - Models’ vulnerability detection accuracy significantly decreased in augmented scenarios (Appendix B, Tables 18–21):
    - In A4 & A5 (library additions), models failed to distinguish between safe and unsafe usage of the same function—suggesting keyword over-reliance.
    - In A2 & A3 (function renaming), models often predicted “vulnerable”/“not vulnerable” based on function names like “vulnerable_func”, irrespective of the implementation.

- **Temperature Effects:**
  - Output consistency for vulnerability detection remained high at both deterministic (T=0.0) and recommended temperature, but “reason” correctness and faithfulness varied unpredictably with temperature and model family.

- **Prompting for Explanation (“Reason”):**
  - Models struggled to generate correct, faithful, and non-hallucinated “why” explanations, even when they guessed the correct label.

- **Best Practices:**
  - Despite adopting recommended prompt engineering practices (including explicit instruction, format constraints, and word limits), LLMs still demonstrated poor reliability in both accurate labeling and faithful reasoning for code vulnerability tasks.

---

**Researcher Recommendations for Future Prompting**
---------------------------------------------------

- *Adopt explicit extraction prompts* for model evaluation, but guard against overfitting to surface cues.
- *Augment code scenarios* to test for semantic and non-semantic cue reliance.
- *Control for model parameters* (temperature, sampling) to analyze consistency.
- *Require faithful justification* in prompt design to measure model reasoning, not just prediction.

**Conclusion**
--------------

The researchers developed and evaluated several explicit prompt strategies (extraction prompts, scenario/augmentation-based prompts, perturbation prompts) to probe the vulnerability detection capabilities and explanation faithfulness of LLMs (like StarChat, CodeLlama). Despite rigorous prompt engineering, including strict instruction and scenario variation, current LLMs proved unreliable, often over-relying on surface textual cues rather than true code logic, with low fidelity in their explanations—highlighting critical limitations in real-world use for vulnerability detection.

PROMPTING STRATEGIES IN THE PAPER

1. **Description and Context**
- The paper proposes and evaluates various prompting strategies to test the capability of Large Language Models (LLMs) to detect and reason about vulnerabilities in code. 
- The strategies differ in terms of complexity, methodology, and the manner in which prompts are constructed and presented to LLMs.

2. **Prompting Strategies Used and Where They Are Discussed**
- The strategies are named and summarized in several tables (notably Table 22, Table 25, Table 26, and Table 27) and identified as S1, S2, ... S6, R1, ... R6, D1, ... D6 corresponding to different styles (e.g., Standard, Step-by-Step, and Definition), as well as ZS-TO, ZS-RO, FS-TO, FS-RO:

    - ZS = Zero-Shot; FS = Few-Shot
    - TO = Task-Oriented; RO = Reasoning-Oriented
    - S = Standard; R = Reasoning; D = Definition

    - Tables and Figures:  
      * “TABLE 22: Evaluation Diversity of Prompts (Ext. Table 11)”
      * “BestPrompts”, “TABLE 25: Evaluation code difficulties (Ext. Table 14)”
      * “TABLE 26: Evaluation Code-Level Augmentations (Ext. Table 15)”
      * Descriptions and prompt examples in figure captions and statistical presentation

3. **Overview of Major Prompting Variants**
- **Standard (S)**: Straightforward queries (e.g., "Is this code vulnerable?").
- **Step-by-Step (R)**: Prompts that explicitly request reasoning (e.g., "Explain step by step if and why this code is vulnerable").
- **Definition (D)**: Prompts that provide the model with the definition of a vulnerability (e.g., info about a particular CWE).
- **Zero-Shot (ZS)**: The model is presented only with the code and the vulnerability identification task, with no examples.
- **Few-Shot (FS)**: Prompts include a few in-context examples of code and vulnerability analyses.
- **Task-Oriented (TO)**: Prompts geared toward a direct answer to the question (e.g., Yes/No).
- **Reasoning-Oriented (RO)**: Prompts require explanatory output, rationale, or justification.
- **Augmentations**: Modifications to code (or prompts) to test robustness.

4. **Location and Examples in the Text**
- The detailed table “TABLE 22: Evaluation Diversity of Prompts (Ext. Table 11)” references prompt diversity.
- Example types: S1, S2...R1, R2...D1, D2...
- Code is followed by, for example, “Is this code vulnerable to CWE-22? Why or why not?”, with variations in phrasing, context, and depth of explanation required.
- In the best prompt tables: codellama13b S1 3/6 S2 3/6 R6 2/6, etc., indicating which strategies score best for different models/CWEs.

5. **Results and Effectiveness of Prompting Strategies**
- **Best Performing Prompts**: For each model and CWE, certain prompts (S1, S2, S5, R4, etc.) consistently yield higher scores for both vulnerability identification and reasoning, with success rates given (e.g., S5 5/6 means 5 out of 6 correct).

- For example, for CWE-614 (Table: 614-EWC):
    - codellama13b S5 5/6, R4 5/6 (indicates high success rate with these strategies)
    - codellama7b R6 4/6, D3 4/6
    - starchat R6 5/6

- Prompt variants requiring detailed reasoning (“Explain why...”) or including definitions often outperform standard binary queries in both vulnerability detection and explanation.

- There is a notable pattern that Reasoning-Oriented and Definition-based prompts show better results for complex and hard-to-detect vulnerabilities.

6. **Prompt Construction Specifics**
- Prompts are constructed using various templates per the above types.
    - Some explicitly ask the model to "Explain step by step."
    - Some provide definitions or context (e.g., “CWE-22 refers to... Does this code suffer from it?”)
    - Some are direct ("Is the following code vulnerable?")
    - Few-shot prompts emulate task setup with 1-2 prior example code analysis pairs.
    - Augmentations: The code snippet is modified or obfuscated in ways (see tables on NT1/NT2, etc.) to assess LLM robustness to superficial code changes.

7. **Prompt Robustness Evaluations**
- The paper systematically checks:
    - Consistency of results across different prompting styles
    - Sensitivity to code augmentations (i.e., does using STRNCPY as a macro for strcpy, or changing variable names, affect LLM output under different prompts?)
    - Effectiveness on both handcrafted and real-world CVE code, as well as trivial/non-trivial code variants

8. **Key Findings**
- No single prompt strategy works universally best; however, prompts that demand explicit reasoning or provide context/definitions generally outperform terse queries, especially on complex scenarios.
- LLMs show non-determinism (varying outputs for the same prompt).
- Most chat-based LLMs (e.g. starchat) benefit from step-by-step and definition-driven prompts.
- Prompt diversity is necessary for a thorough evaluation; simple prompts may underestimate LLM capability.

**SUMMARY TABLE OF PROMPT STRATEGY EFFECTIVENESS**

| Model          | Prompt Type         | Best Score (per CWE)   | Effective on         |
|----------------|--------------------|------------------------|----------------------|
| codellama13b   | S5, D1, R4, S2     | 4-5 / 6                | Most CWEs / Med-Hard |
| codellama7b    | R6, S5, D4, S4     | 3-5 / 6                | Reasoning-oriented   |
| starchat       | R6, D5, R3, S2     | 4-5 / 6                | Reasoning, Definitions|

See detailed rows in “BestPrompts” tables.

**Robustness to Code Augmentations**
- Prompt strategy effectiveness degrades as code is obfuscated or abstractions are introduced, more so with standard prompts than with reasoning-based ones.

---
**CONCLUSION**
- Multiple prompt strategies were systematically considered; their influence on LLM capability to detect and reason about vulnerabilities was exhaustively benchmarked for diverse code and augmentation scenarios.
- Reasoning and definition-based prompts are more successful at extracting accurate and robust answers from LLMs in vulnerability analysis, especially under complex or adversarial conditions.
