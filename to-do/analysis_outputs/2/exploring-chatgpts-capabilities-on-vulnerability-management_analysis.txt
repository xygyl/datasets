Certainly! Here's a text file mock-up summarizing all details about the prompting strategies discussed in the paper "Exploring ChatGPT’s Capabilities on Vulnerability Management" by Peiyu Liu et al., including where they're explained, their results, success/failure, and all specifics of the researcher's approaches.

**Prompting Strategies in "Exploring ChatGPT’s Capabilities on Vulnerability Management"**

---

**1. Where Prompting Strategies Are Explained**

Prompting strategies are primarily discussed in Section 2.2 (ChatGPT and Prompt) and Section 3 (Methodology/Evaluation Pipeline). Figure 2 (Evaluation pipeline) illustrates the workflow with emphasis on the prompt engineering part. Additional discussions on prompts and their impact appear in the Abstract, Introduction, and Results/Discussion sections.

---

**2. Overview of Prompting Strategies**

The researchers consider several prompting approaches for using ChatGPT in vulnerability management tasks:

- **0-shot prompting**: Task instructions are directly given to ChatGPT with the query/sample, no additional context or demonstrations provided.
- **1-shot prompting**: A single demonstration/example is shown within the prompt, representing how to process a similar input.
- **Few-shot prompting**: Multiple demonstrations/examples are provided within the prompt.
- **Template-based prompting**: Custom-designed templates for each task, aimed at maximizing clarity and relevance.
- **Self-heuristic prompting**: A novel approach where ChatGPT is prompted to extract “expertise” or abstract task strategy from demonstration examples, and then that summary/expertise is integrated into the final prompt, rather than just giving examples verbatim.

---

**3. Pipeline for Prompt Engineering and Evaluation**

The pipeline consists of:
1. **Template Designing**: Various templates (instructional, example-based, etc.) are designed for each task.
2. **Best Template Selection**: A small “probe-test” dataset (10% of samples) is used to evaluate and select the best-performing prompt for each task.
3. **Large-Scale Evaluation**: The selected best prompt is evaluated on the entire dataset for each task, comparing ChatGPT’s results to state-of-the-art (SOTA) models.

---

**4. Implementation Details and Task-Specific Prompting**

- Prompts ranged from simple task instructions (0-shot) to complex inclusion of contextual info and manual task expertise.
- Examples of information included:
  - Task overview and requirements
  - Sample input/output pairs (“demonstrations”)
  - Extracted expertise/heuristics queried from ChatGPT or crafted by researchers
  - Multiple prompt “templates” were trialed for each task

For each of the six vulnerability management tasks, multiple prompt templates and examples were tested to find the most effective format.

---

**5. Results of Prompting Strategies**

- **0-shot prompts**: Sometimes effective, especially on tasks requiring “common sense” or generic understanding, such as summarizing bug reports.
    - However, 0-shot performance dropped on specialized tasks demanding domain knowledge or context (e.g., patch correctness, vulnerability severity).
- **Few-shot/1-shot prompts**: Adding demonstrations/examples didn’t consistently yield better performance and, in many cases, the gain was marginal or inconsistent. Randomly chosen examples could even degrade results.
    - Key finding: **Simply adding random demonstrations isn’t a reliable way to improve performance** on complex, multi-step tasks.
- **Manual expertise in prompts**: When prompts included human-annotated knowledge or observed “summarized expertise” (the rationale/strategy abstracted from demonstration examples), ChatGPT’s performance improved for some tasks.
    - Example: Security bug report identification benefited from expert feature explanations.
- **Self-heuristic prompting**: Asking ChatGPT to extract generalizable expertise from several examples, then using that as a “strategy summary” in the prompt, led to marked gains in tasks such as vulnerability severity evaluation.
- **Information overload in prompts**: More information did not always help. Overly lengthy prompts with too much data could confuse or mislead ChatGPT, resulting in errors or misuse of irrelevant context.

---

**6. Specific Findings and Conclusions on Prompt Strategies**

- ChatGPT occasionally outperformed SOTA without fine-tuning, especially on document-processing tasks, with an appropriate prompt.
- For complicated, code-intensive tasks, **expertise extraction and careful prompt composition** were much more effective than generic few-shot prompting.
- **Effective prompt engineering is task-dependent**: Simple tasks may need only minimal prompting, while complex tasks require targeted manual knowledge or heuristic synthesis.
- Automated (“self-heuristic”) prompt creation by extracting strategies from examples is a promising direction, superior to just example listing.
- **Prompt misinterpretation/misuse is a risk**: Directing ChatGPT’s attention to helpful info and away from irrelevant content (good prompt design) is still an open challenge.

PROMPTING STRATEGIES IN THE PAPER: EXPLANATION, RESULTS, AND DETAILS

=======================================================================

1. OVERVIEW OF PROMPTING STRATEGIES

The paper systematically investigates the impact of different prompt engineering strategies on ChatGPT’s performance for software vulnerability management tasks. It emphasizes the need to design templates able to guide large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT, particularly because prompt construction plays a crucial role in task performance—especially when tasks are complex or domain-specific.

The prompting strategies considered in the work are detailed, evaluated, and compared to state-of-the-art (SOTA) approaches. Prompts are crafted both manually and through guided model usage, then systematically tested to assess effectiveness.

=======================================================================

2. WHERE THE STRATEGIES ARE EXPLAINED IN THE PAPER

- Section 3: "Evaluation Framework", particularly §3.1 (Evaluation Pipeline), §3.3 (Prompt Design and Implementation).
- Section 4: "Evaluation Results", specifically the Bug Report Summarization and Security Bug Report Identification subsections.
- Table 2: Provides the templates for task prompt generation, with names, descriptions, and formats for each strategy.
- Detailed implementation process and rationales are discussed throughout §3.3, with further examples and supporting material in the Appendix (referenced as Table 12–14 and Figure 3, 6).

=======================================================================

3. LIST OF PROMPT TEMPLATES/STRATEGIES

Table 2 in the paper summarizes several prompt templates:

3.1 Zero-shot (0-shot) Prompt
- Description: Describes the task and directly gives the input query; no demonstration examples.
- Template: USER <task description> <input>

3.2 One-shot (1-shot) Prompt
- Description: Describes the task and provides a single, randomly-selected demonstration example before the query.
- Template: USER <task description> <demonstration example> <input>

3.3 Few-shot Prompt
- Description: Describes the task and provides multiple (specifically 4, per the paper) randomly-selected demonstration examples before the query.
- Template: USER <task description> <demonstration example 1> ... <demonstration example 4> <input>

3.4 General-information (general-info) Prompt
- Description: Integrates role assignment and supplements the task with task-related role information and instructions using system and user roles (includes zero-shot chain-of-thought—zero-CoT—instruction).
- Template: 
  SYSTEM <role> <task description> <reinforce>
  USER <task description> <task confirmation>
  ASSISTANT <task confirmation>
  USER <positive feedback> <input> <zero-CoT> <right>    

3.5 Expertise Prompt
- Description: Builds upon general-info prompt by providing manually summarized domain-specific expertise alongside the task description.
- Template:
  SYSTEM <role> <task description> <expertise> <reinforce>
  USER <expertise> <task description> <task confirmation>
  ASSISTANT <task confirmation>
  USER <positive feedback> <input> <zero-CoT> <right>

3.6 Self-heuristic Prompt
- Description: ChatGPT is given several labeled examples and asked to summarize the underlying knowledge itself (e.g., behavioral heuristics), which is then used as part of the prompt to guide future responses.
- Template:
  SYSTEM <role> <task description> <reinforce>
  USER <knowledge> <task description> <task confirmation>
  ASSISTANT <task confirmation>
  USER <positive feedback> <input> <zero-CoT> <right>

See Table 2 in the paper for format details.

=======================================================================

4. METHOD OF TEMPLATE DESIGN AND IMPLEMENTATION

- All prompt templates are constructed manually using heuristics derived from the literature (citations [7, 19, 23, 29, 37, 40, 42, 50]).
- Demonstration examples for 1-shot/few-shot are randomly selected from the training dataset; for few-shot, four examples are used as this is found to give “considerably good performance” as per prior research.
- The expertise prompt draws knowledge from domain-specific documentation and academic literature.
- In the self-heuristic prompt, ChatGPT is provided a batch of labeled examples and is asked to summarize the knowledge or rules implied by those examples. This summary is then embedded into the following prompts.
- Each template’s effectiveness is evaluated using 100 random samples from the training data. Templates are refined based on manual analysis of ChatGPT’s responses.

=======================================================================

5. RESULTS OF THE PROMPTING STRATEGIES

5.1 General Results

- The performance of ChatGPT varies depending on the template, the underlying model (gpt-3.5 versus gpt-4), the complexity of the task, and the domain expertise required.
- For tasks akin to natural language processing (NLP), such as bug report summarization, simple prompts (zero-shot, one-shot, few-shot) are surprisingly effective.
- For more complex, expertise-demanding tasks, augmenting prompts with explicit role assignment and domain knowledge sometimes improves recall but can degrade precision or introduce hallucinations/confusion.

5.2 Detailed Results (Examples from Evaluation Sections):

A) BUG REPORT SUMMARIZATION (Table 3)

- Zero-shot: Even the basic zero-shot prompt achieves strong performance, outperforming SOTA in both recall and F1 on ROUGE metrics.
- Few-shot: Adding 4 demonstration examples (few-shot) as context improves most scores over zero-shot, especially for ROUGE-L and F1.
- General-info, expertise, and self-heuristic: Surprisingly, adding domain info or summary knowledge did **not** consistently increase performance and sometimes reduced it—likely because summarization as a task aligns well with ChatGPT’s existing pretraining.
- Model comparison: Upgrading to gpt-4 (from gpt-3.5) with few-shot prompts further improves results.

B) SECURITY BUG REPORT IDENTIFICATION (Table 4)

- Zero-shot: Initial performance is mediocre; ChatGPT hallucinates definitions and fails to align with ground truth.
- One-shot: Exposure to true examples (e.g., memory leak report classified correctly) greatly increases recall, but at the cost of precision—ChatGPT sometimes over-generalizes.
- Few-shot: High recall but low precision; ChatGPT tends toward labeling many reports as "security relevant."
- Expertise prompt: Providing explicit domain expertise in prompt improves some metrics, but can make ChatGPT “conservative,” potentially under-calling true positives, or conversely hallucinate further.
- Self-heuristic: Similar pattern as expertise, with mixed improvements.
- Model comparison: gpt-4 increases recall even further but also raises false positive rate.

5.3 Insights & Recommendations
- For straightforward or standard NLP-like tasks, less is more: simple prompts suffice.
- Demonstration examples (few-shot/one-shot) are effective when some domain adaptation is needed but the task does not require deep domain expertise.
- Explicitly integrating domain knowledge or asking for summaries (self-heuristic/expertise) has mixed or sometimes negative effects unless the task is truly dependent on unique expert insight (and clarity does not cause confusion).
- gpt-4, when available, almost always outperforms gpt-3.5, especially with few-shot prompts.
- Additional instructions (role assignment, positive feedback, step-by-step reasoning) are more beneficial in tasks requiring complex logic and precise definition.

=======================================================================

6. SUMMARY TABLE

| Prompt Type   | Benefits                                | Pitfalls/Failures                    | Best Used For ...                       |
|---------------|-----------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| Zero-shot     | Simple, effective for NLP tasks         | Fails in adapting to nuanced domains | Standard text tasks                      |
| One-shot      | Jump in recall after seen example       | Over-generalization, drops precision | Tasks adapted by small context           |
| Few-shot      | Best overall for generalization         | High false positives in some tasks   | Problems balancing recall/precision      |
| General-info  | Good for complex logic                  | Can confuse LLM in simple NLP tasks  | Domain-specific, high expertise tasks    |
| Expertise     | Encodes domain rules, boosts precision  | Overly restrictive, hallucinations   | Tasks with strict expert criteria        |
| Self-heuristic| Leverages LLM's own summarization skill | Mixed performance, hard to control   | When ready-made rules are unavailable    |

=======================================================================

7. KEY PROMPTING STRATEGY TAKEAWAYS

- Systematic testing of multiple types of prompts is essential; optimal strategy is highly task-dependent.
- “Enriching” the prompt with additional role assignments, domain definitions, and demonstration examples only works when such info is both accurate and required by the task—otherwise, it can be detrimental.
- Complex prompt templates may yield better recall at the expense of precision, demanding careful consideration and perhaps downstream human review/workflow integration.
- Self-heuristic prompts—where the model is asked to summarize the key patterns from labeled data—are innovative, but not always reliably better than classic few-shot.
- All template details (actual prompts and examples) are made available by the authors for reproducibility and further research.

=======================================================================

8. END NOTES

- All prompt templates—including specific format, instruction content, and demonstration example construction—are provided in the paper’s supplementary repository for reproducibility.
- The findings encourage future research into task-aligned automatic prompt generation and hybrid prompt engineering combining expert and model-inferred knowledge.

Prompting_Strategies_in_ChatGPT_Security_Evaluation.txt
=======================================================

Overview
--------
The paper investigates the impact of different prompting strategies on ChatGPT’s performance in three major security software engineering tasks:
1. Security-related bug report identification  
2. Vulnerability severity evaluation (mapping to CVSS metrics)  
3. Vulnerability repair with code generation

For each task, the authors compare various state-of-the-art (SOTA) and custom prompt templates, analyze results, and discuss the reasons for relative success or failure.

Prompting Strategies Discussed
------------------------------

The core prompting strategies examined are:

- **0-shot prompt:** No examples are provided; ChatGPT is simply presented with the task.
- **1-shot prompt:** One demonstration example is provided in the prompt.
- **Few-shot prompt:** Several (but limited) demonstration examples are given (constrained by token limits).
- **General-info prompt:** The prompt provides general task-related information aimed at context-setting.
- **Expertise prompt:** The prompt delivers expert knowledge or high-level domain summaries (either written manually or with ChatGPT's help), such as directly stating what constitutes a security bug or defined CVSS metrics.
- **Self-heuristic prompt:** The prompt is constructed by summarizing demonstration examples using ChatGPT itself, distilling characteristic knowledge and then integrating it into the prompt.

Where Each Strategy is Explained
-------------------------------

Descriptions of these prompt strategies are spread across Section 4, under each of the three evaluations:
- **4.1 Security-Related Bug Report Identification** (especially the paragraph starting "The Impact of Prompts and Models")
- **4.3 Vulnerability Severity Evaluation** (see "The Impact of Prompts and Models", the self-heuristic variant is described in depth, including in Figure 4)
- **4.4 Vulnerability Repair** (see "The Impact of Prompts and Models")

Details of Prompt Strategies and Specifics
------------------------------------------

**0-shot Prompt:**
- No in-context examples, simply instruct ChatGPT to accomplish the given task.
- Baseline for comparison.
- E.g., "Is this bug report security-related?" (for bug report ID task).

**1-shot Prompt:**
- A single demonstration is prepended, showing a typical query and a successful answer.
- Intended to supply minimum task context to LLM.

**Few-shot Prompt:**
- Includes several example queries and labeled answers.
- Limited by prompt/token budget.
- Aim: To help ChatGPT recognize the task pattern and expected output.

**General-info Prompt:**
- Supplies extra context or general guidelines about the task but not explicit domain knowledge.
- Example for bug report ID: “When deciding if a bug report is security-related, consider if it mentions memory safety, user permissions, or access violations.”

**Expertise Prompt:**
- Supplies high-level domain-specific knowledge, possibly in the form of written expertise, mnemonic, or a definition.
    - E.g., “Bug reports related to memory leak or null pointer problems should be seen as security bug reports.”
    - For CVSS mapping: definitions of CVSS metrics (Attack Vector, Complexity, etc.) are included.
- Some expertise prompts are hand-written; in other cases, these are generated or compressed with ChatGPT's help (by summarizing demonstration examples).

**Self-heuristic Prompt:**
- ChatGPT is first provided with demonstration examples, then asked to summarize key features or heuristics (i.e., “What rules/criteria do these examples share?”).
- The resulting summary (in ChatGPT’s own words) is then integrated into a new prompt, used as context for future queries.
- E.g., For CVSS evaluation, ChatGPT summarizes what distinguishes each metric (AV:Network, AV:Adjacent, etc.) based on the input corpus, and that summary is then used to instruct ChatGPT.

Results of Prompting Strategies
------------------------------

**1. Security-Related Bug Report Identification**
- **Expertise Prompt** yields significant gains: On gpt-4, F1 and G-measure were 32.6% and 23.4% higher than the Farsec baseline, but still ~20% below the best SOTA method (DKG).
- **Higher-level knowledge** (expertise) in prompts helps ChatGPT focus on relevant information; e.g., explicitly stating that memory leak/null pointer bugs are security-relevant.
- **Prompt selection effect is complex:** Some prompts increase precision at the cost of recall, and vice versa. General-info increased precision but reduced recall.
- **Failure modes:** Even with expertise prompts, ChatGPT tends to miss security issues tied to resource leaks. Lack of bug report details (on impact/exploitability) leads to further errors.

**2. Vulnerability Severity Evaluation (CVSS Mapping)**
- **0-shot/1-shot/few-shot prompts:** ChatGPT performs poorly, especially on metrics where high-quality, succinct expertise is required and the distinction is subtle (PR: High metric recall for 0-shot: 36.8% vs. 94.5% for SOTA).
- **Expertise Prompt (manual):** Slight improvement, but hard to perfectly handcraft.
- **Self-heuristic Prompt:** Significant improvement. For example, on gpt-3.5, recall and precision improve by ~1.6x and 1.73x over the expertise prompt.
- **Model impact:** GPT-4 outperforms GPT-3.5 by 10.5% in average precision (holding self-heuristic prompt fixed).
- **Failure modes:** Ambiguity in the CVSS metrics themselves and limited diversity in heuristic examples hinder performance.

**3. Vulnerability Repair**
- **0-shot/1-shot/few-shot prompts:** Adding real bug patch examples did not substantially improve the ability to generate a valid patch; each vulnerability requires specific understanding, and repair cannot be entirely analogical.
- **Expertise prompt:** Including commentary that describes the vulnerability (e.g. "BUG: stack buffer overflow") helped, enabling fixes for two more vulnerabilities vs. other prompts.
- **GPT-4 vs. GPT-3.5:** GPT-4 is notably better, with higher compilation and valid repair rates.
- **Failure analysis:** Many failures stem from prompt-induced grafting or syntax errors; researchers developed custom code-grafting workflows for better integration, confirming that ChatGPT output often needs significant post-processing for completeness.
- **Takeaway:** Providing explicit, concise vulnerability descriptions in the prompt is key, but success is still limited by code complexity and ChatGPT's inherent programming limitations.

Key Findings on Prompting
-------------------------
- The impact of the prompt structure is task- and model-dependent: Sometimes adding context improves precision but hurts recall, or vice versa.
- Manually constructed expertise prompts have value but are limited; self-heuristic prompts, extracted with LLM assistance, provide strong gains.
- Token limitations make it difficult to supply a large number of examples (“long” few-shot) in a single prompt.
- Leveraging ChatGPT to summarize and extract knowledge from demonstration examples (self-heuristic) can compress expertise and improve performance.
- For code repair tasks, patch examples are less helpful than concise vulnerability summaries; GPT-4’s stronger synthesis abilities are advantageous.

References to Where Specific Strategies Are Discussed
-----------------------------------------------------
- Prompting variations: Sections 4.1, 4.3, 4.4
- Expertise prompts: In each evaluation’s “Impact of Prompts and Models” paragraph
- Self-heuristic prompt: Most thoroughly in Section 4.3 ("Vulnerability Severity Evaluation") and Figure 4
- Additional performance tables: Table 4, Table 5, and Table 6 with prompting template columns

Summary Table of Prompting Strategies
-------------------------------------

| Task                       | 0-shot | 1-shot | Few-shot | General-info | Expertise      | Self-heuristic    |
|----------------------------|--------|--------|----------|--------------|----------------|-------------------|
| Bug Report Identification  |  –     |  –     |    –     |  ±           | √ (big gain)   | not tested        |
| Vulnerability Severity     |  poor  |  poor  |   poor   |  ±           | ±              | √ (large gain)    |
| Vulnerability Repair       |  –     |  –     |    –     |    –         | √ (gain)       | not tested        |

(– = baseline/poor, ± = mixed results, √ = significant improvement vs. baselines)

Final Implications
------------------
- Advanced prompts (expertise, self-heuristic) improve performance for complex security NLP tasks.
- For challenging, high-ambiguity domains, extracting and compressing diverse real-world examples into domain heuristics (with LLM aid) enables significantly better results than simple demonstrations.
- Prompting strategy choice should be guided by task complexity, LLM capability, and token constraints.
- Many tasks still require substantial downstream post-processing of model output.

Prompting Strategies in LLM-based Vulnerability Management Research
======================================================================

**1. Overview and Context**

The paper investigates the effectiveness of ChatGPT (GPT-3.5 and GPT-4) on several vulnerability management tasks, with a heavy emphasis on how different prompting strategies impact performance. The researchers compare ChatGPT and its prompting styles to state-of-the-art (SOTA) automatic and learning-based systems across tasks such as patch correctness assessment, stable patch classification, and bug report summarization.

**2. Prompt Types and Where They’re Explained**

The prompting strategies are primarily described in the context of the patch correctness assessment, stable patch classification, and the user study on bug report summarization. Prompts are detailed and compared in Tables 8, 9, 10, and 11. The specifics of each prompt type, the manner of their construction, and their target use cases are embedded throughout Section 4.5, 4.6, 4.7, and in the accompanying discussion before and after the tables.

**Prompt Types Used:**

- **0-shot**
  - No examples or additional instructions.
- **1-shot**
  - A single example provided to guide the model.
- **Few-shot**
  - Multiple examples provided before the main input.
- **General-info**
  - Prompts include general information and guidance.
- **Expertise**
  - Prompts are augmented with expert domain instructions or definitions (e.g., explicit definition of “stable patch”).
- **Self-heuristic**
  - Custom, heuristic-driven instructions created by the researchers.
- **Desc-code**
  - Prompts include both the patch code and its textual description.
- **Code-only**
  - Prompts include only the patch code.

**3. Prompting Strategy Results and Analysis**

Below, task-by-task summaries describe the deployment and effectiveness of each prompting strategy.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Patch Correctness Assessment (Sections around Table 8, 9, 10)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Where Described:**  
Prompt types are listed in Table 8 and discussed in Section 4.5: “Patch Correctness Assessment”.

**Key Observations:**
- Advanced prompts (1-shot, few-shot, general-info, expertise, self-heuristic) outperform the naive 0-shot prompts.
  - Example: For GPT-3.5, -recall increases variously by 16–50% from 0-shot to more advanced prompts.
- GPT-4 consistently beats state-of-the-art (Quatrain, Panther, Invalidator) on “identifying incorrect patches” (-recall).
  - Indicating better capability to reduce the risk of security instability.
- F1 scores: Advanced prompting techniques notably improve F1 performance, sometimes surpassing or approximating SOTA tools (especially with self-heuristic prompts in GPT-4).
- Desc-code vs. Code-only:
  - Providing both code and textual description (desc-code) sometimes led ChatGPT to judge only the consistency between code and description, not actual patch correctness.
  - Removing the description and only providing code (code-only) improved performance on GPT-4 to be comparable with SOTA.
- Too much or misused information in prompts can degrade performance: “More information is not always better.”

**Prompt Template Successes:**
- Self-heuristic (custom-designed expert prompt) yielded the best or among the best performances for GPT-4 and GPT-3.5.
- Expertise-driven prompts stress the importance of clear definitions for complex concepts (e.g., what makes a patch stable).

**Prompt Failures and Insights:**
- 0-shot and basic prompts frequently underperformed, leading to mistakes and hallucinations.
- When tasked with correctness using just patch code, LLMs sometimes misinterpret the logic/intent of patches, especially with non-standard or tool-generated fixes.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Stable Patch Classification (Descriptions preceding Table 11)
----------------------------------------------------------------------

**Where Described:**  
Table 11, Section 4.6: “Stable Patch Classification”.

**Findings:**
- ChatGPT (with different prompts) compared to PatchNet (SOTA for binary patch stability).
- 0-shot, 1-shot, few-shot, general-info: Precision scores near 0.5, recall scores close to 1
  - This indicates the model frequently assumed presented patches were “stable,” a hallucination caused by an insufficient definition in the prompts.
- Shift to “expertise” prompts, which provide a clear, specific definition of a stable patch (“fixing a problem that causes a build error, an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security issue, or some ‘oh, that’s not good’ issue”).
  - Result: Remarkable performance improvement; accuracy, precision, and F1 scores all rose.
  - In the test set, GPT-4 with the expertise prompt reached Recall 0.950 (even exceeding PatchNet’s 0.907) though its other metrics lagged.

**Prompt Failures and Insights:**
- LLMs hallucinate and over-generalize when the prompt is vague.
- Heuristic or sharply defined prompts are critical for reducing such hallucinations on complex, real-world judgment tasks.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Bug Report Summarization (User Study: Section 4.7, Figure 5)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Where Described:**  
Section 4.7: “User Study”.

**Prompt Usage:**
- Several prompt strategies used: 0-shot, 1-shot, few-shots, general-info, self-heuristic, expertise, and GPT-4’s few-shots.
- Users were not told which system wrote each summary; they rated the output on correctness, conciseness, readability (scale: 1–5).

**Results:**
- ChatGPT summaries, especially with few-shot and heuristic prompts, had higher correctness and readability scores than the baseline (iTAPE).
- iTAPE had higher conciseness, but sometimes omitted key information.
- Most effective ChatGPT prompts maximized correctness and clarity (even if lengthier).

**Prompt Successes:**
- Detailed, example-rich (few-shot), or self-heuristic prompts produced the most developer-suitable summaries.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
General Successes and Failures Across Prompt Strategies
------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Successful Strategies:**
- Including domain-specific, expert definitions in the prompt (expertise) improved consistency, recall, and resistance to hallucination.
- Self-heuristic prompts, customized using researcher insight, often delivered. the highest balanced performance.
- Few-shot and 1-shot prompts made the LLM less likely to hallucinate or over-generalize, especially on binary or complex labeling tasks.

**Less Successful Strategies:**
- 0-shot, generic prompts consistently underperformed—LLM hallucination increased, recall/precision balance was poor.
- Information overload (desc-code) without clear task focus sometimes led ChatGPT to answer the wrong sub-task (description matching instead of correctness assessment).
- Lack of explicit problem context (e.g., in some patch correctness, vulnerable variable info missing) led to guessing or errors.

**Implications:**
- More information is not always better—clarity, task-specific and accurate input is superior to blanket inclusion of all possibly relevant data.
- Mitigating hallucination by crafting precise, domain-anchored prompts remains a key challenge for LLM-assisted code security tasks.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Synthesis: Researcher Strategies and Recommendations
------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Prompt Design Principles Observed:**
1. **Start with baseline (0-shot), iterate via inclusion of examples (1-shot/few-shot) and domain guidance (expertise/self-heuristic).**
2. **Explicitly define task terms (e.g., “stable patch”) within the prompt when possible.**
3. **When providing multiple types of input (code+description), ensure the prompt steers the LLM towards the proper evaluation task.**
4. **Use prompt engineering to combat known LLM weaknesses (hallucination, over-generalization).**
5. **Manual debugging of failure cases—use them to refine prompt design (e.g., removing noisy/unhelpful context).**

**Conclusion:**
- LLMs, specifically ChatGPT, can approach or exceed SOTA automated tools when equipped with well-engineered, custom prompts, especially in real-world vulnerability management tasks.
- Expert-driven, precise, and example-rich prompts are most effective.
- Research and operational use should emphasize prompt tuning and context curation, not just “more data.”

**1. Overview: Where Prompting Strategies Are Explained**

The paper discusses prompting strategies throughout the Methodology, Discussion, and Limitations/Future Work sections. Specific details about manual prompt construction and evaluation appear in:

- Section discussing the evaluation setup ("Prompting techniques" under Limitations and Future Works)
- The methodology for testing (as inferred from references to prompt construction and evaluation pipelines)
- Table/figure references (implied, not included in the excerpt, but methodology and results discussion indicate this)

---

**2. Prompting Strategies Used**

- *Manual Prompt Construction*: The researchers manually designed prompt templates based on empirical analysis and references to prior work in LLM evaluation (notably [34]).
- *Types of Prompting Explored*:
    - **0-shot prompts**: Prompts in which the model is given a task directly, without examples.
    - **1-shot/few-shot prompts**: Prompts where the model is provided with one or a few demonstration examples taken from the training dataset.
    - **Self-heuristic prompts**: Custom prompt templates constructed through analysis and iteration, refined using observed mistakes in the training dataset.
    - **Expertise prompts**: Prompts that explicitly ask ChatGPT to "act as" or "think like" an expert in the relevant domain, intended to mitigate hallucinations and increase informativeness.
- *Evaluation pipeline & generalizability*: The constructed prompt templates and evaluation pipeline are designed to be generally applicable to other large language models (LLMs), not just ChatGPT.

---

**3. Details & Specifics of the Researcher’s Prompt Strategies**

- All example-driven prompts (1-shot, few-shot, self-heuristic) exclusively use material from the training dataset.
- Prompt templates are refined based on errors and shortcomings detected during training set evaluation—test data is never used for prompt engineering to avoid data leakage.
- Strict separation between training and testing data for prompt design: probe-test datasets are always kept isolated from any prompt adaptation processes.
- Manual prompt engineering is adopted because Automatic Prompt Engineering (APE) is noted as "challenging" and remains complex (see reference [40]).
- Prompt improvements are a stepwise process: observations → identify failure cases or weaknesses → redesign prompt → evaluate on training set → freeze and apply to test set.

---

**4. Results of the Prompting Strategies**

- *Prompt Effectiveness*: No single prompt type (0-shot, 1-shot, few-shot, self-heuristic, expertise) consistently outperforms others across all tasks in human evaluations.
- *Output Quality*: 
    - GPT-4 outputs (and presumably the best ChatGPT prompts) tend to be more concise and readable while maintaining high accuracy.
    - Intermediate user groups rate ChatGPT’s outputs more favorably than professional groups, possibly reflecting that the LLM's style and level resonates more with those less immersed in the professional domain.
    - Professionals still rate ChatGPT’s results highly on correctness and readability, but the "incremental information" provided is less impactful due to their pre-existing expertise.
- *Potential biases and adaptation pitfalls*: To minimize bias and ensure prompt evaluation fairness, all prompt engineering steps are restricted to the training split—no test data contamination is allowed.
- *Evidence against overfitting or memorization*: Several checks (e.g., F1-ROUGE similarity, exact and fuzzy match rates) indicate minimal overlap between ChatGPT’s generations and ground-truth from test data, supporting methodical soundness.

---

**5. Success and Limitations**

- *Successes*: The manually crafted prompting strategies enable ChatGPT to perform at or above the level of multiple SOTA methods, especially in tasks involving summarization, code, and bug report understanding, as demonstrated by empirical comparison.
- *Limitations*:
    - The manual prompt engineering approach is labor-intensive and may not scale well or automatically adapt to new tasks without human intervention.
    - The complexity and size of the tasks' influence on prompt effectiveness were not systematically explored and are flagged as future work.
    - Automatic Prompt Engineering (APE) is recognized as an important future direction to improve adaptability and reduce human effort.
    - Real-world, interactive scenarios and prompt adaptability to multiple interconnected tasks remain areas for future research.
    - Despite prompt optimization, hallucination remains an open challenge in LLM output integrity for vulnerability management tasks.

---

**6. Future Directions**

- Exploration of APE to streamline and improve prompt construction
- Integrating ChatGPT prompts and interactions across more comprehensive, real-world vulnerability management workflows
- Comparative evaluation with other LLMs and open-source alternatives, potentially using similar or improved prompts for benchmarking

---

**References to Prompting Strategies within the Paper:**

- “Prompt templates are improved based on mistakes observed in training dataset... Overall, the test dataset remains untouched during prompt adjustment and probe-testing, ensuring a fair evaluation of ChatGPT’s capabilities.”
- “We manually constructed prompt templates based on prior works in LLM evaluation[34] and our empirical analysis. This manual approach is adopted due to the inherent challenges of automatic prompt engineering (APE)... our prompt templates and evaluation pipeline are generally applicable to other LLMs.”
- “Demonstration examples used in the 1-shot, few-shot and self-heuristic prompts come from the training dataset... probe-test dataset is separated from the training dataset.”
- “No single prompt consistently outperforms others in human evaluations, but gpt-4’s outputs tend to be more concise and readable while maintaining high accuracy.”

---

**Conclusion Summary**

The research demonstrates that manually engineered prompting—using a structured, training-data-only, mistake-driven refinement process—allows ChatGPT to perform competitively in vulnerability management tasks. However, improved, automated, and more adaptive prompting strategies remain a key avenue for future advancement.

**Title: Summary of Prompting Strategies for Security Bug Report Classification**

---

**1. Overview**

The paper investigates several prompting strategies to enhance large language models (LLMs) for the task of classifying security bug reports (SBRs) versus non-security bug reports (NBRs). The strategies focus on constructing effective prompts to elicit accurate and context-sensitive responses from language models, particularly for domain-specific tasks such as vulnerability identification.

---

**2. Prompting Strategies Explained (with Sources from Provided Text)**

*Where Strategies are Explained:*
- The prompting strategies are described in Table 12 (Prompt skills for the general-info template), Table 13 (Templates for task prompt generation), the descriptions in '[18]', '[37]', '[46]', and throughout the methodological sections referencing expertise extraction and self-heuristic prompts.
- Figure 6 provides a diagram of self-heuristic prompt generation using demonstration examples.

**2.1 Zero-shot Prompting**
- *Template*: "USERDecide whether a bug report is a security bug report (SBR) or non-security bug report (NBR). Bug report: <bugreport> Category:"
- *Explanation*: The model receives only the task description and one input, with no prior examples. This tests the model's ability to generalize from instruction alone.

**2.2 One-shot Prompting**
- *Template*: Includes a single demonstration example followed by the input.
- *Example*: "USERDecide whether a bug report is a security bug report (SBR) or non-security bug report (NBR). Bug report: MemoryLeak in about:memory1. Open a new tab and enter about:memory... Category: SBR ### Bug report: <bugreport> Category:"
- *Explanation*: Provided one demonstration/example to guide the model.

**2.3 Few-shot Prompting**
- *Template*: Multiple examples precede the input.
- *Example*: "USERDecide whether a bug report is a security bug report (SBR) or non-security bug report (NBR)... Bugreport: <example1> Category: NBR ###[...]### Bugreport:<bugreport> Category:"
- *Explanation*: The model learns through several task examples before attempting the new instance.

**2.4 General-info Prompting**
- *Template and Skills (from Table 12)*:
    - **role**: Ask the model to adopt a task-specific role ("You are Frederick, an AI expert in bug report analysis.").
    - **reinforce**: Repeat essential task or instruction elements for emphasis.
    - **taskconfirmation**: Simulate a confirmation dialog to ensure the task is understood.
    - **positivefeedback**: Give positive encouragement before the main query.
    - **zero-CoT**: Zero-shot chain-of-thought prompting – instruct the model to "think step by step."
    - **right**: Encourage/model to reach the correct conclusion.
- *Purpose*: Combines various prompt skills to maximize task performance, particularly in knowledge-intensive scenarios.

**2.5 Self-heuristic Prompting**
- *Explanation*:
    - **Extraction of Expertise**: ChatGPT/LLM is used to extract critical domain-specific knowledge by reviewing demonstration examples.
    - **Incorporation**: This knowledge (e.g., recognizing memory leaks or null pointer issues as SBRs, including severity metrics like CVSS AV) is incorporated back into the prompt.
    - Referenced in the system role: "When analyzing the bug report, take into account that bug reports related to memory leak or null pointer identification problems should be seen as security bug report."[49]
- *Purpose*: To further improve model performance on domain-specific, nuanced, or intricate tasks.

---

**3. Task Prompting Templates and Examples (Table 13)**

- **SYSTEM/USER/ASSISTANT roles**: Highly structured, often simulated dialogues reinforcing expertise and instruction compliance.
- **Templates combine**:
    1. Role and expertise definition (e.g., SYSTEM: You are Frederick...),
    2. Task instructions and confirmations,
    3. Encouragement/feedback,
    4. Step-by-step reasoning (Zero-CoT),
    5. Mandate for correct conclusion.

---

**4. Results of Prompting Strategies**

- The study indicates that prompts with enhanced expertise and domain-specific cues (self-heuristic and general-info) outperform basic zero-shot/few-shot prompts in accuracy and reliability for SBR detection.
- Cited from text: "These skill have shown superiority in traditional NLP tasks[19]."
- *Effectiveness*: Self-heuristic and expertise-infused prompts significantly improve performance, particularly for "intricate tasks demanding domain knowledge, such as vulnerability severity evaluation."
- *Traditional vs. Enhanced Prompts*: General and zero-shot prompts work but are surpassed by prompts leveraging extracted expertise and self-heuristic feedback.

---

**5. Specific Details of Prompts Used**

*Components & Features Drawn from Tables 12 & 13:*
- **Expertise Infusion**: "Security bug reports (SBR) are...identifying and addressing vulnerabilities, flaws, or weaknesses in a software system that could potentially be exploited..."
- **Knowledge Infusion**: Explicit mention of CVSS metrics, network/adjacency/physical severity, error/vulnerable code references.
- **Classification Rules**: Memory leaks, null pointer exceptions, patch correctness, and stable patch criteria are encoded into the prompt instructions and demonstration examples.
- **Step-by-step Reasoning**: Explicit instruction for the model to reason stepwise before finalizing classification.

---

**6. Success Metrics and Observations**

- Self-heuristic and general-info prompting led to measurable improvements in SBR classification.
- *Empirical Results (as summarized)*: Enhanced prompts are "superior in traditional NLP tasks" and specifically highlighted as necessary for handling domain-knowledge-intensive cases.
- The study recommends detailed, expertise-rich prompts, especially for tasks where domain context is critical.

---

**7. Conclusion**

The research demonstrates that advanced prompting strategies—particularly those incorporating explicit knowledge, demonstration-based learning (few-shot), self-heuristic expertise extraction, and detailed task/role modeling—substantially improve the performance of LLMs in classifying security bug reports. Traditional zero-shot and direct instruction prompts are effective to a baseline level but are outperformed by prompts that simulate human-like expertise and iterative reasoning.
