Prompting Strategies in "Multi-role Consensus through LLMs Discussions for Vulnerability Detection"
===============================================================================================

1. **Where Prompting Strategies Are Explained**
--------------------------------------------------
Prompting strategies are mainly discussed in Sections 2 ("Multi-Role Approach") and 3 ("Preliminary Evaluation") of the paper. The specifics of the strategies—including the design of initial, role-specific prompts and the iterative discussion process—are outlined in Section 2, while Section 3 describes how the prompt strategies are deployed, differentiated, and evaluated in experiments. Additional details about prompt forms (Basic vs. Chain-of-Thought) are present in Section 3.1, under "Baseline", and Table I presents experimental results for each prompting method.

2. **Description of the Prompting Strategies**
--------------------------------------------------

### a. **Role-Based Prompting**

**Initialization Stage:**
- The process begins with an LLM acting as a “Tester.” The tester receives a prompt with:
    - Its role-setting (“You are a software tester in a code review process…”)
    - The assigned task (e.g., vulnerability detection, categorization)
    - The code segment to analyze.
- The tester is instructed to output:
    - A binary judgment: 1 (vulnerable) or 0 (non-vulnerable)
    - A brief justification/reasoning (concise due to token limits, to guide further discussion)

- After the initial tester output, this information, together with an initial prompt, is forwarded to an “LLM-Developer,” who’s also prompted in their simulated role: 
    - The developer is cued to bring the developer’s perspective, using the tester’s prior reasoning as context.

**Discussion Stage:**
- The tester and developer engage in iterative dialectic interactions. Each round involves:
    - One role posing a query or challenge.
    - The other responding, re-evaluating, and providing new insights.
- Prompts are engineered to ensure each role sticks to its perspective (tester as security-minded, developer as implementation-oriented).
- The interaction continues in a “pose query - deduce response - relay insight” loop for up to five rounds (maximum discussion depth = 5), or until consensus is reached. Each response is capped at 120 tokens for efficiency.

**Conclusion Stage:**
- The discussion is concluded when consensus is reached or the round limit is hit.
- The tester’s final judgment is taken as the definitive result.

### b. **Prompt Types: Basic vs. Chain-of-Thought (CoT)**
- The paper evaluates two specific prompting templates for both single-role and multi-role settings:
    - **Basic Prompt:** Directly asks the LLM (tester) whether the provided code contains a vulnerability (in categories: FC, AE, AU, PU) with no explicit reasoning steps required.
    - **Chain-of-Thought (CoT) Prompt:** Instructs the LLM to reason step-by-step, guiding it to analyze the code logically and systematically before making a final judgment.

3. **How the Prompt Strategies Were Implemented and Used**
---------------------------------------------------------------
- For experiments, all LLMs used are instances of “gpt-3.5-turbo-0125.”
- **Single-Role Approach:** One LLM in “tester” role, prompted using either a basic or CoT prompt, classifies code in one step.
- **Multi-Role Approach (Proposed):** Two LLMs in simulated tester and developer roles, with explicit role-based prompting, engage in an iterative dialogue using sequential prompts based on the other’s output (as described above). Both basic and CoT variants of the prompts are tested in this setup.

4. **Results of Prompting Strategies**
---------------------------------------------
The results (see Table I in Section 3.2) reflect the comparative effectiveness of the strategies:

- **Overall Findings:**
    - The multi-role strategy, whether using Basic or CoT prompting, consistently outperforms the single-role strategy.
    - Average improvements from multi-role prompting:
        - Precision Rate: **+13.48%**
        - Recall Rate: **+18.25%**
        - F1 Score: **+16.13%**
    - Improvements are most pronounced in datasets with a high proportion of vulnerable code segments.
    - Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting slightly outperforms basic prompting in all approaches, indicating that step-by-step reasoning further enhances performance.

- **Computation Cost:**
    - The token count (and thus computational cost) increases substantially (~484%) in the multi-role method, due to the multi-turn discussions between simulated roles.

- **Empirical Example:**
    - The discussion process allowed testers to initially misclassify a segment as vulnerable, but due to the developer perspective (and pointed queries about buffer size management), the tester corrected the judgment—a capacity missing from single-pass prompting.

5. **Success and Specifics of the Researcher's Prompt Strategies**
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
- **Success:**
    - The combination of role-specific initialization plus dialectic, multi-turn prompting achieves substantial, statistically significant gains in all measured metrics (precision, recall, F1).
    - The collaborative discourse between distinct simulated roles leads to a richer, more nuanced consideration of edge cases that single-role methods often miss.
    - CoT (chain-of-thought) prompting further boosts these effects by encouraging explicit logical reasoning.

- **Specifics:**
    - All prompts fix the role context (“Tester” or “Developer”), and instructions reinforce persona-appropriate reasoning styles.
    - Each prompt is tightly constrained in output length and rounds to maintain efficiency and focus.
    - The multi-round prompt sequence was capped at a maximum of 5 to prevent endless dialogues and to keep token cost manageable.

- **Limitations:**
    - Increased computation and token usage (484% over single-pass) is a trade-off for improved accuracy.
    - The study notes that even more sophisticated prompting or in-context learning could further improve collaborative outcomes in future work.
