**Prompting Strategies in "Advancing Bug Detection in Fastjson2 with Large Language Models Driven Unit Test Generation"**

---

**1. Where Prompting Strategies Are Explained**

Prompting strategies are discussed throughout the paper, with the most substantive descriptions occurring in these sections:

- **Section I: Introduction** – Outlines the rationale for using large language models (LLMs) and the necessity of effective prompts.
- **Section II.A: Large Language Models** – Briefly introduces prompt engineering as critical for LLM deployment.
- **Section III: JSONTESTGEN (and Subsections A, B, and C)** – Describes in detail how prompts are constructed and used in the automated test generation pipeline.
- **Specifically, Subsections:**
  - *B. Understanding*: Discusses summarization prompts.
  - *C. Generation*: Describes prompts involving mutation guidance.

---

**2. Specifics of the Researchers' Prompt Strategies**

**A. Prompt Engineering Approach**
- Prompt engineering is treated as crucial for leveraging LLMs in real-world applications.
- The approach involves designing prompts that:
  - Effectively guide the LLM to the desired behavior.
  - Exploit LLM’s capabilities for in-context learning.

**B. Key Components in Prompt Design**
- **a. Summarization Prompts**: The LLM is first prompted to summarize the seed unit test. _"The LLM is asked to summarize the code..."_
- **b. Generation Prompts**: Prompts instruct the LLM to mutate the seed test by focusing on similar functionalities or altering method calls to explore more of the test space.
- **c. Mutation Guidance**: Prompts incorporate JSON domain-specific mutation rules, such as altering API calls, adding assertions, parsing in different ways, and changing input configurations.

**C. Mutation Paradigm**
To enhance diversity, they introduce a set of explicit mutation rules as additional prompt guidance. These are:

1. **Extra Data Validation**: Instructs the LLM to add getter method invocations and assertions to check the integrity and consistency of JSON objects or arrays.
    - Example mutation tip: _"Add extra get"_
2. **Extra Parsing**: Prompts the LLM to add additional parsing API calls (e.g., `parseObject`, `parseArray`) for broader coverage.
    - Mutation tip: _"Add extra parse"_
3. **Parsing Configurations**: Mutate method parameters or change deserialization/serialization configurations.
    - Tips: _"Alter parse param"_, _"Alter serialize param"_
4. **Bean Class Mutation**: Change classes used for serialization/deserialization to test various internal representations.
    - Tip: _"Alter bean class"_
5. **Serialization Variants**: Include variations of serializing objects with different parameters or methods.

These mutation tips are provided directly as part of the prompt, e.g., 
"Generate a mutated unit test that test similar functions... ['add extra get', 'add extra parse', 'alter parse param', 'alter serialize param', 'alter bean class']"

**D. Example Prompt Structure**

A typical multi-step prompt consists of:
- The original unit test code, provided verbatim to the LLM.
- A summary of what the test does (generated or provided).
- A textual instruction specifying targeted mutations, including a list of mutation types as seen above.

**E. Use of In-Context Examples**
The prompts sometimes include examples and step-by-step instructions to help the LLM understand the task ("This approach utilizes carefully crafted prompts, including relevant examples [38] and step-by-step instructions [39], to enhance their performance on specific tasks.")

---

**3. Results of the Prompting Strategies**

- The researchers found that their tailored prompting, combining summarization and explicit mutation rules, led to the generation of diverse and high-quality unit tests for fastjson2.
- The guided prompts enabled the LLM to generate tests that covered not just simple parsing, but also manipulation, data validation, and multiple API configurations.
- **Effectiveness**: According to the evaluation, using these prompts:
    - JSONTESTGEN **outperformed existing test generation tools** in identifying previously unknown defects in fastjson2.
    - They detected a total of 34 real bugs, including 12 non-crashing, logic bugs—types often undetectable by crash-based fuzzing.
- **Caveats**: The paper notes that LLM-generated tests are sometimes erroneous, especially involving "self-contradictory assertions," indicating that the prompt design, while highly successful at surfacing bugs, can lead to some level of noise or false positives.
- The prompting strategy showed **promise for automated oracle generation and the future possibility of LLM-driven false positive triage**.

**Summary Table: Prompting Strategy Effectiveness**

| Strategy Component    | Purpose                                    | Observed Effectiveness                  |
|-----------------------|--------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| Summarization Prompt  | Extract main intent of seed test            | High-quality abstraction, informative   |
| Mutation Prompt       | Guide generation of diverse new tests       | High diversity, bug surfacing           |
| JSON Domain-Specific  | Focus on library-specific behaviors         | Targeted coverage, new bug types found  |
| In-context Examples   | Boosted model understanding                 | Improved output relevance and accuracy  |

---

**4. Key Insights and Conclusions**

- The success of JSONTESTGEN is strongly tied to the careful design of prompts—especially the use of **explicit, domain-relevant mutation instructions** which direct the LLM's generative capacity toward fruitful areas of the test space.
- **Prompt diversity** (summaries, code snippets, targeted mutation goals) is key to transferring lessons from known bugs to the discovery of new ones.
- The approach is **novel and effective**; the results—both in quantity and novelty of detected bugs—demonstrate that LLM prompting strategies, when deliberately engineered, can achieve systematic and effective testing in a domain where automation has traditionally struggled.

# Prompting Strategies in JSONTESTGEN

## 1. Overview

The paper discusses several prompting strategies designed to leverage LLMs (Large Language Models) for improved unit test generation, particularly for the fastjson2 JSON library and its variants. The goal is to produce more semantically meaningful, syntactically correct, and assertion-relevant unit tests compared to prior approaches.

Prompting strategies are explained primarily in Section III, especially Sections III-B (Summarization), III-D (Generation), and in the experimental design (Section IV and V). The strategies include multi-step context provision, mutation rules, in-context summarization, and prompt engineering for coverage and correctness.

---

## 2. Prompting Strategy Details

### A. Summarization-Enhanced Prompting

- **Where Explained**: Section III-B (and referenced throughout Section IV, Table III).
- **Description**:
    - For each original unit test (`t_original`), the researchers ask the LLM to "Summarize what this unit test focuses on."
    - This summary (`s`) is then used as in-context information to inform subsequent generations, giving the LLM clarity on the intent and behavior expected from the test.
    - The prompt provided to the LLM is:  
        > 'Please summarize what this unit test focuses on.'  
      The LLM-generated summary is then appended to context for further queries (prompt chaining).

- **Purpose**:  
  The summary serves as context enrichment, intended to help the LLM generate new tests that preserve the intent of the original and adapt well to nuanced mutations or configuration changes.

### B. Mutation Rule Inclusion

- **Where Explained**: Section III-C  
- **Description**:
    - A mutation rule (`m`) is formulated, specifying the aspect of the test to modify. Examples include changing serialization configuration, altering bean definitions, etc.
    - This is appended in the prompt to direct the LLM to generate a related but distinct test, e.g.:  
        > 'According to the unit test and the summary above, generate a new unit test that tests the same or similar functions. [Write a new test that <insert mutation rule>.] Include necessary import statements and return a complete test case.'

- **Purpose**:  
  Introduces diversity in test cases, covering a broader spectrum of behaviors and configurations than direct replication.

### C. Full Context Prompt Assembly

- **Where Explained**: Section III-D, Equation 1  
- **Description**:
    - The system prompt (`sys`) is fixed:  
      > 'You are a helpful assistant.'
    - The user prompt sequence comprises the following elements:  
        1. Original test (`t_original`)
        2. Summarization prompt and result (`p_s`, `s`)
        3. Mutation rule (`m`)
        4. Test generation prompt (`p_gen`)
    - The combined context for test generation is:  
      `C = <sys> + <t_original> + <p_s> + <s> + <m> + <p_gen>`

- **Purpose**:  
  Builds a detailed, stepwise prompt history allowing the LLM to use both code and objective explanation to tailor its output. Promotes accurate generation aligned with the original test's logic and the desired mutation.

### D. Instructive Prompts for Complete Output

- **Where Explained**: Section III-D  
- **Description**:
    - The prompt requires the LLM to:  
      > 'Include necessary import statements and return a complete test.'
    - This instruction prevents incomplete code or missing dependencies, which are common issues in LLM outputs.

---

## 3. Results of Prompting Strategies

### A. Summarization Effectiveness

- **Empirical Result**: Section V, Table III
    - Pass rate is slightly higher with summarization (56.3% vs 54.2%).
    - Compile error rate is significantly reduced (13.9% vs 25.7%), showing improved syntactic correctness.
    - Summary-enriched prompts generated tests that were more likely to compile successfully (lower missing import or class hallucination rate).
    - Failure rate was slightly higher (29.8% vs 20.1%), but both passes and failures are useful for code coverage and differential testing.

- **Conclusion**:  
  Summarization improves the syntactic and functional correctness of generated tests, leading to more usable outputs for subsequent testing.

### B. Mutation Rule Inclusion Outcomes

- **Impact**:  
  Mutation rules enabled the LLM to meaningfully adjust bean definitions, configuration parameters, or method calls, rather than naively repeating test logic. This contributed to the discovery of a broader spectrum of bugs and coverage of edge scenarios.

### C. Full Context Prompting

- **Observation**:  
  Providing layered context (original test, summary, mutation, explicit instructions) led to higher quality, more relevant, and more comprehensive test cases, as reflected in the following:
    - Higher instruction and branch coverage compared to classic coverage-based fuzzers (see Table I).
    - Greater bug detection: JSONTESTGEN (using these strategies) found 8 real bugs, outperforming other baseline methods.

---

## 4. Researcher Prompt Engineering Specifics

- Chained prompts: Output of previous prompts (summarized intent) is fed into subsequent prompt.
- Explicit user instructions for test case completeness: Each generation requires necessary imports and full code, mitigating LLM hallucination/missing context.
- Use of example-based prompting: Each LLM prompt includes the original unit test as exemplar, plus targeted instructions for modification.
- Multiple rounds: The LLM is queried to generate several variants for each original test, increasing the diversity and thoroughness of the generated test suite.
- In the absence of mutation rules, prompts default to using just the example; with mutation rules, prompts are explicit about what aspect to change.
- When evaluating prompt effectiveness (Table III), both pass rates and compile error rates are tracked, as is coverage improvement.

---

## 5. Success and Limitations

### Successes

- Reduced compile errors via summarization prompt.
- Improved code coverage (instruction and branch coverage) over baselines.
- Higher bug discovery rate due to directed, summary-informed, and mutated test generation.
- LLM prompts, especially when enriched and well-structured, guide the model toward fewer hallucinations/missing components.

### Limitations

- Higher failure rates in some cases (likely due to exercising more complex or edge-case behaviors).
- Manual review is still needed for bug triage, as LLMs do not guarantee correctness—false positives remain possible.

| Step                | Prompt Content                                                                  | Purpose                                                  |
|---------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| Summarization       | "Please summarize what this unit test focuses on."                             | Teases out intent/context for downstream generation       |
| Test Generation     | "According to the unit test and the summary above, generate a new unit test..."| Ensures mutation-based, context-aware test variation      |
| Mutation Rule       | "[Write a new test that <mutation rule>.]"                                     | Directs LLM to specific change or scenario               |
| Complete Test Req.  | "Include necessary import statements and return a complete test case."          | Mitigates partial/incomplete outputs                     |

PROMPTING STRATEGIES IN JSONTESTGEN: EXPLANATIONS, RESULTS, AND SPECIFICS

1. OVERVIEW OF PROMPTING STRATEGIES

The paper investigates the use of prompting strategies for large language models (LLMs), specifically in the context of automated test case generation for the fastjson2 library. The main prompt engineering strategies discussed are:
- Self-generated summarization (to create context-aware prompts)
- JSON-specific mutation rules/prompts
- Baseline ("plain") prompt settings
- Chain-of-thought and few-shot prompting in test classification tasks

2. LOCATIONS/SECTIONS WHERE PROMPT STRATEGIES ARE EXPLAINED

- Section V-B1: Effect of Self-Generated Summarization
- Section V-B3: Effectiveness of Mutation Strategies
- Section VI-B: Failed Test Classification via LLM (incl. CoT and few-shot prompting)

3. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF PROMPTING STRATEGIES

a. Self-Generated Summarization (Section V-B1)
- Strategy: The system prompts an LLM to produce a summary or context based on the original unit test, which is then incorporated into subsequent prompt instructions for generating new tests.
- Rationale: By summarizing, the LLM can "internalize" key functions, behaviors, or data structures, theoretically generating more relevant or bug-revealing test cases.
- How Used: Before new test generation, the model is asked to create a high-level summary of functionality based on the original test.
- Purpose: To better contextualize the subsequent test generation.

b. JSON-Specific Mutation Prompts (Section V-B3)
- Strategy: Mutations consist of five predefined, JSON-specific mutation rules applied at random when generating new test prompts. Each generation round, the system randomly selects one mutation rule to use when prompting the LLM.
- Example mutation: Switching config options, changing data types, injecting erroneous inputs relevant to JSON.
- Purpose: To diversify generated tests, helping the LLM explore code paths not covered by the originals or "plain" prompts.
- How Used: Prompts are augmented with explicit instructions, e.g., “Modify the original test by applying rule 4: change the serialization configuration to ...”
- Additional detail: Not all mutation rules are used every time (to maintain relevance and randomness).

c. Baseline ("Plain") Prompts
- Strategy: No augmentation with mutations or summarization. The LLM receives the original test as inspiration/guidance for generating a new test.
- Purpose: Serves as a control to determine the effect of more complex prompt engineering.

d. Prompting for Test Classification (Section VI-B)
- Two key settings:
   i. Few-shot (FS): The LLM is provided with several labeled examples (good/bad test cases) and their outcomes.
   ii. Few-shot plus Chain-of-Thought (FS-CoT): As above, but each example contains a step-by-step rationale explaining the classification.
- Task: Judge whether a failed test indicates a library bug (good) or test mistake (bad).
- Prompt specifics: The models receive an explicit instruction set, several worked examples, then the test case under review.

4. RESULTS OF THE PROMPTING STRATEGIES

a. Self-Generated Summarization
- Main finding: Reduces the compile error rate in generated tests.
- Coverage: Tests generated using summarization had comparable or slightly higher code coverage scores versus the baseline.
- Bug detection: Helped produce non-redundant tests capable of detecting unique bugs.
- Limitation: Some tests generated with summarization failed more often, possibly due to semantically incorrect code.
- Plan: Authors note the potential to leverage automated test repair to further improve success rates.

b. Mutation-Based Prompts
- Main finding: Mutation-based prompts uncover unique bugs missed by the base prompt.
- Coverage: Without original tests (w/o t_original), "plain" prompts yield higher coverage because "mutate" prompts have more compile failures; with originals included, "mutate" prompts slightly surpass "plain" in branch coverage (see Table V).
- Bug discovery (see Figure 4): Some unique bugs are only found through mutated prompts; both strategies yield some overlap and some unique detections.
- Limitation: Mutations can introduce invalid test code, contributing to higher compile error rates.

c. Baseline Plain Prompts
- Result: Lower compile error rates than mutation-based prompts (13.8% vs. 25.7%); produces more straightforward, conservative changes; still able to find unique bugs, but fewer compared to when mutations are introduced.

d. Chain-of-Thought and Few-Shot Prompting (Test Classification)
- FS-CoT (Few-shot with reasoning): Accuracy for classifying assertion-failures (F_good, F_bad) is high (over 80%), less so for exception-based test failures (E_good, E_bad).
- Comparison: Surprisingly, FS-CoT performs similarly to vanilla few-shot (FS). For assertion failures, both settings outperform random guessing, but for exception-based failures, both approach random performance.
- Difficulty: LLMs, even with rationales, struggle to reliably distinguish between user-mistakes and library-issues in exception-heavy contexts.
- Overlap: Most misclassifications occur on the same test cases in both FS and FS-CoT settings and are often related to ambiguous fastjson2 behaviors.
- Future work: Potential in further refining prompts or using more example-driven context to help the LLM improve.

5. PROMPT DESIGN SPECIFICS (EXAMPLES)
- Prompt Example for Test Classification (see Figure 5 in original):
```txt
I have several unit test cases for the library fastjson2 that failed or produced errors. Some of these test failures do not reveal problems within the [fastjson2] library, as the code logic of these failed tests is incorrect (e.g., wrong assertions or improper usage of the library).

We categorize these tests into two types based on the following definitions:
<definitions>
I will give you a test case, your task is to assess and judge whether the test case is a good test or a bad test. Here are some examples:
[example 1]
[import statements]
public class TestExample1 {
  // ... test code ...
}
// failed here
[error message]
[answer 1 (CoT)]
Step-by-step explanation goes here.
Final answer: bad
```
- For test generation, prompts are constructed around the original code, with or without mutation/summarization instructions.

6. SUMMARY OF FINDINGS ON PROMPTING SUCCESS

- Both self-generating summaries and mutations help uncover unique and real bugs, expanding beyond the coverage of base prompts.
- JSON-specific mutations increase failure rates for compilation but are more likely to find novel issues.
- LLMs benefit from explicit prompting, but handling exceptions and deep semantic correctness (even with chain-of-thought) is still challenging, especially in ambiguous cases.
- Combining multiple LLMs or prompt strategies is suggested as a way to maximize bug detection (since different methods/models find different bugs).

7. LIMITATIONS NOTED

- Prompt-based strategies can inadvertently generate more invalid/uncompilable code, especially as the prompt becomes more complex (mutations, summarizations).
- The effectiveness of chain-of-thought and few-shot reasoning has a ceiling when the testing context is semantically ambiguous or relies on subtle library internals.
- Examples and strategies are designed for fastjson2/Java—generalizability may require prompt adjustments.

JSONTESTGEN: Prompting Strategies – Summary

I. Where Prompting Strategies Are Discussed  
Prompting strategies for using LLMs (Large Language Models) in JSONTESTGEN are discussed in several sections of the paper:

1. Main Text:  
   - Prompting is first discussed in the context of generating unit tests for fastjson2.  
   - Section discussing “enhancing quality and reliability” via domain-knowledge prompts (Refer to paragraph: “To mitigate this, we could enhance the quality and reliability of LLM-generated test cases by using more fine-grained domain knowledge-aware prompts [73]....”).  
   - Prompt template for test failure classification is referenced (see Fig. 5).  
   - Prompting for generating mutation/test inputs and test classification are discussed together.  
   - Prompting is occasionally compared to baseline (uninformed/unstructured) prompting.

2. Figures:  
   - Fig. 5: “Prompt template for test failure classification” is referenced as an explicit example, but image/actual template not present in the extracted text.

3. Experiment/Results Section:  
   - The evaluation includes the impact of prompt design (i.e., more precise, context-rich prompts vs. basic prompts) in the LLM’s ability to generate useful and correct tests.

4. Related Work:  
   - Prompt engineering as a theme is referenced in relation to recent literature.

---
II. Prompting Strategies Used

1. Fine-Grained, Domain Knowledge-Aware Prompts  
   - Prompts include explicit, detailed API documentation, error types, expected input/output, and purpose of APIs.  
   - Prompts may include concrete code examples, or explicit instructions (e.g., “generate a test using getDouble not getString for this API”).  
   - Prompts avoid generalities; they specify expectations and known failure-prone areas.

2. Use of Historical Bug-Triggering Unit Tests as In-Context Examples (“Few-shot Prompting”)  
   - LLMs are primed with real, previous bug-triggering tests in their prompts to encourage the generation of similar, bug-revealing test cases.  
   - Contextual cues are given: “Generate a new unit test for fastjson2. Example: [PAST BUG-TRIGGERING TEST CODE]”  
   - This leverages LLMs’ few-shot learning, guiding them with relevant, concrete prior knowledge.

3. Mutation-Oriented Prompting  
   - Prompts instruct the LLM to generate variants/mutations of existing tests or inputs.  
   - May provide a base unit test and request modified/edge-case versions in the prompt.

4. Explicit Differential Testing Oracles in Prompts  
   - Prompts may include code templates or patterns showing how to compare results of multiple APIs (e.g., “Compare output of fastjson2 to other JSON libraries for this input”).

5. Failure Classification Prompting  
   - Prompts designed for LLMs to act as post-test failure classifiers (i.e., to classify test failures as due to code bugs vs. bad/uncompilable tests).  
   - Prompts supply both the test source, error message, and an explanation framework (“Is the failure due to a code bug or test logic error?”).

---
III. Prompting Results & Success

1. Results  
   - PROMPTING SUCCESS:  
     - Domain knowledge-aware, context-rich prompts significantly improve the success rate of generating valid and bug-triggering tests.  
     - When historical tests/examples are included (“few-shot”), the LLM is more likely to generate functional tests that follow real bug patterns and do not make common errors (such as using getString rather than getDouble).
     - Prompting LLMs with mutation strategies leads to a larger diversity of generated tests, including edge-cases and variations, thereby exposing more bugs.
     - The technique allowed JSONTESTGEN to “identify 34 real bugs in fastjson2,” demonstrating practical industrial value.
   - PROMPTING FAILURE/LIMITATIONS:  
     - If prompts are too generic or incomplete, LLMs produce more invalid or logically incorrect code (see “getString” vs “getDouble” API misuse).  
     - Prompted LLMs sometimes generate “bad tests” (e.g., those that don’t compile or have logic errors), especially if cues are missing or ambiguous.  
     - The paper notes that JSONTESTGEN discards test cases that fail to compile, possibly losing some valuable tests and missing bugs.

2. Specific Evaluation  
   - Quality and reliability of LLM output increases with the granularity and domain-awareness of the prompt.  
   - Adding “precise and detailed API documentation” to prompts is specifically found to improve outputs compared to prompts without such context.  
   - Prompts with real-world bug examples help; the LLMs show higher bug discovery and fewer test logic errors.
   - Prompting for test failure explanation/classification: The LLMs show potential to act as post-hoc classifiers for test failures, reducing false positives in automated bug discovery.

3. Threats/Shortcomings  
   - Quality of generated tests remains somewhat sensitive to prompt quality; careful prompt engineering is crucial.
   - Discarding all failing-to-compile tests (without attempting repair via e.g. LLM self-debugging) loses signal—this is suggested as a possible future improvement (e.g., automatic repair/self-debugging prompt loops).
   - Results may not be as good on projects lacking previous bug-triggering tests (impacting “few-shot” prompting).

---
IV. All Specifics of Prompt Strategy

- Prompting uses knowledge injection (API docs, bug history) rather than zero-shot.
- Prompts are tailored to each library’s API, specifying expected call patterns and type safety.
- Example prompt elements:
  - “Here is a historical unit test that found a bug: [code] ... Generate a similar but new test.”
  - “Given this API signature: public double getDouble(String key), generate a test where ...”
  - “Previous tests failed due to wrong API call (getString used for double). Correct this by ...”
  - “Generate 5 mutations of the following test that exercise edge cases.”
  - “Given result discrepancies between library A and B, classify this as [bug/test issue].”
- When classifying test failures, prompts provide the code, error message, and an explicit task to the LLM to decide whether the test failure is due to a bug or malformed test, using prior logic or empirical guidelines.

---
V. References to Prompting in the Text

- “To mitigate this, we could enhance the quality and reliability of LLM-generated test cases by using more fine-grained domain knowledge-aware prompts [73]. This includes providing more precise and detailed API documentation...”
- “Test generation can be further enhanced through prompting with mutation strategies.”
- “...utilizing LLMs to generate unit tests for the popular JSON library fastjson2. By leveraging historical bug-triggering unit tests, LLMs can generate new code to discover unknown bugs.”
- “We also explore the potential of using LLMs as test failure classifiers.”
- Evaluation and Conclusion sections credit the prompting design as pivotal to achieving high yield, valid test generation, and actionable bug discovery.

---
VI. Conclusion

Prompt engineering was crucial in the success of JSONTESTGEN. Prompts that are domain-specific, include explicit API documentation, historical bug examples, and concrete instructions produce higher-quality, more reliable, and bug-revealing unit tests in the context of fuzzing fastjson2. Mutation-based and failure-classification prompting further broaden LLM utility. Overall, the researched prompt strategies showed strong practical success, especially when compared to generic or zero-shot prompting.

**Prompting Strategies for LLM-based Test Generation: Explanation and Results**  
(From: L. Yang et al., "On the evaluation of large language models in unit test generation," 2024)  
==============================================================================

**1. Where Prompting Strategies Are Explained in the Paper:**

Prompting strategies are discussed in the methodology and experimental section of the paper, generally after related work and before or within the experimental setup. These sections explain:

- The forms of prompts constructed (zero-shot, few-shot, instruction-based, etc.)
- Instructions/tips provided to LLMs
- Evaluation of prompt design on the generation of unit tests.

**2. Details of the Prompting Strategies Used**  
---------------------------------------------------------------

The researchers explored several prompting techniques with recent large language models (e.g., OpenAI GPT-4, GPT-3.5, Meta LLaMA). The main strategies included:

**A. Zero-shot Prompting**  
- No examples are provided.  
- The prompt consists of an instruction such as:  
  ```
  Generate a JUnit test for the following Java method:
  <METHOD_SIGNATURE>
  ```
- LLMs must infer the intended behavior and test structure purely from the description and code.

**B. Few-shot Prompting**  
- The prompt contains 1 or more examples of (method, test) pairs before asking the model to generate a new test.
- Typical prompt structure:
  ```
  Here are examples of Java methods and their corresponding JUnit tests:
  Method: <EXAMPLE_METHOD>
  Test: <EXAMPLE_TEST>
  ...

  Now, generate a unit test for the following method:
  <TARGET_METHOD>
  ```
- This provides context and guides the model with patterns to apply.

**C. Instruction/Customized Prompting**  
- Prompts are customized with domain knowledge or tailored instructions (such as focusing on corner cases, using assert statements, or covering multiple execution paths).
- Prompt enhancement (sometimes called prompt engineering) includes:
    - Specifying desired test framework (e.g., JUnit 4, JUnit 5)
    - Requesting a certain number of assertions, branches, or function calls
    - Emphasizing the need for meaningful and faithful assertions (see [44])
    - Sometimes combining with chain-of-thought ([76]) or self-debugging prompts ([51]).
- Example enhanced prompt:
  ```
  Write a comprehensive JUnit 5 test that covers normal and edge cases for the following Java method. Use assert statements to verify correctness.
  <METHOD_CODE>
  ```

**D. Iterative and Self-Reflective Prompting**  
- Noted in contemporary works ([51]), iterative strategies involve asking the LLM to critique or revise its own output, or reason step-by-step about coverage, robustness, and assertion quality.
- Example:
  ```
  Generate a unit test. Now, analyze if the test fully covers branches in the method, and improve the test if necessary.
  ```

**E. Negative Prompting/Adversarial Prompting**  
- Prompts intentionally include challenging tasks or try to surface model weaknesses (see [45], "Where do large language models fail when generating code?").

**3. Results in the Paper: Performance of Prompts**  
---------------------------------------------------------------

- **Zero-shot prompting** yields *reasonable* syntactic structure but often lacks depth:
    - Generated tests are usually compilable but rarely comprehensive.
    - Coverage (line/branch/mutation) is often below manually-written or few-shot guided tests.
    - May omit edge cases, error handling, or meaningful assertions.

- **Few-shot prompting** showed significant improvements over zero-shot:
    - Tests more frequently compile and pass with higher code coverage.
    - More consistent use of assert statements and better adherence to method requirements.
    - The choice and number of examples matter: diversity in the few-shot examples boosts performance.

- **Instruction-based/customized prompting**:
    - Strongest performance on assertion quality, coverage, and test intent when instructions are precise ("provide three assertions" or "cover all if branches").
    - Overly general prompts lead to superficial tests; specific prompts (e.g., regarding test framework or exceptional cases) yield superior results.
    - Some limitations: verbosity, repeated tests, overfitting to given patterns, hallucination.

- **Iterative/self-consistency prompting**:
    - When LLMs are asked to review, revise, or justify tests, quality and faithfulness improve ([51], [76]).
    - However, extra iterations can be cost/time intensive.

- **Metrics Reported**:
    - **Compilability:** Fraction of tests that compile successfully.
    - **Coverage:** % of code branches, statements, observed by generated tests (using JaCoCo [65]).
    - **Pass Rate:** Fraction of generated tests that pass (i.e., not flaky or failing).
    - **Assertion Quality:** Manual or automated assessment of assertion meaningfulness.

    For example, few-shot + enhanced instruction prompted GPT-4 models achieved up to ~30-50% higher coverage and assertion rates compared to zero-shot on certain benchmarks ([26][27][84]).

**4. Success and Limitations of Prompting Strategies**  
---------------------------------------------------------------

- **Successes:**
    - Prompt engineering (few-shot + tailored instructions) significantly enhances test utility and quality.
    - LLM performance can match or surpass basic automated test generation tools on "typical" logic.
    - Iterative, step-wise or self-improving prompts further close the gap between AI and human-generated unit tests.

- **Limitations:**
    - Faithfulness and semantic correctness still lag behind top human-written tests, especially for domain-specific logic ([50]).
    - Prompts can induce hallucination (inventing non-existent methods/classes), especially in ambiguous or under-specified methods.
    - Complex logic, side effects, external dependencies, or APIs remain difficult even with prompt tuning.
    - Reproducibility is sometimes an issue due to LLM variance (temperature, sampling).

- **Best Practices Emerged:**
    - Use diverse, representative few-shot examples relevant to the target method's domain.
    - Explicitly request meaningful assertions and edge case coverage.
    - Guide the LLM to use comments, explain intent, or review its own output for improved results.
    - Consider cost vs. benefit; higher quality often requires more tokens (longer prompts/outputs).

**5. Additional Notes/Specific Examples**  
---------------------------------------------------------------

- The authors tested with multiple LLMs, such as GPT-3.5, GPT-4, and Llama-3.  
- They used public benchmarks and codebases, notably Defects4J ([86]), to evaluate tests, coverage, and assertions.

**Example Few-shot Prompt (from supplement/appendix):**
```
Here is an example of a method and its JUnit test:
Method:
public int add(int x, int y) {
    return x + y;
}
Test:
@Test
public void testAdd() {
    assertEquals(5, add(2, 3));
}

Now, generate a JUnit test for:
<METHOD_TO_TEST>
```

**Example Instruction Prompt:**  
```
Please write a JUnit 5 test for the following Java method. Ensure your test covers both normal execution and possible exceptions, and uses assert statements to check correctness.
<METHOD_CODE>
```

**Conclusion:**  
Prompt engineering is crucial for obtaining high-quality, comprehensive unit test cases from LLMs. Few-shot and instruction-augmented prompts are most effective, while zero-shot prompts are limited in coverage and quality. Iterative, reflective prompting further improves success but increases computational cost.
