SkipAnalyzer Prompting Strategies: Summary and Outcomes
=======================================================

I. Where Prompting Strategies are Explained
-------------------------------------------
Prompting strategies are primarily introduced and discussed in:

- Section I. Introduction
   - The paper outlines the use of "prompt engineering" in the context of leveraging LLMs such as ChatGPT.
   - The researchers mention exploring various prompting strategies, including zero-shot, one-shot, and few-shot prompting.

- Section II. Background
   - Further details on prompt engineering methods are provided.
   - The section explains zero-shot, one-shot, and few-shot (K-shot) strategies, as well as the Chain-of-Thought (COT) prompting technique.
   - The importance of precise and context-aware prompts is emphasized to maximize LLM capabilities in static code analysis tasks.

II. Prompting Strategies Discussed
----------------------------------
The main strategies discussed and implemented in the paper are:

1. Zero-shot Prompting
   - The LLM is prompted to perform a task (e.g., bug detection, false-positive filtering, or patch generation) without any prior input/output examples.
   - Assumption: The model should infer the correct answer using general knowledge.

2. One-shot Prompting
   - An additional example (input/output pair) is presented before the main prompt, providing one context sample to guide the model.

3. Few-shot Prompting (K-shot)
   - Multiple (K) examples are provided in the prompt before the main query.
   - This approach is designed to help the model generalize patterns from the given samples.

4. Chain-of-Thought (COT) Prompting
   - The prompt either contains step-by-step reasoning (thinking steps) in the examples or asks the LLM to output explanations of its own reasoning process.
   - This is done to enhance the correctness of generated outputs.

Implementation details:
- The authors adhere to best practices in prompt construction, ensuring prompts are precise and context-aware.
- The researchers experiment with these strategies using both ChatGPT-3.5 Turbo and ChatGPT-4 models.

III. Specifics of the Researchers' Prompt Strategies
----------------------------------------------------
- The researchers tested all major prompting paradigms for all three SkipAnalyzer components (bug detector, false-positive filter, patch generator).
- Strategies were systematically explored by:
   - Varying the type and number of examples (zero, one, or multiple)
   - Adjusting prompt structure to improve clarity and context
   - Experimenting with inclusion/exclusion of explanatory (“think aloud”) steps (COT)
- Prompts were tailored to each of the three component tasks (bug detection, false-positive filtering, patch generation).
- Context sensitivity: The prompts explicitly referenced the code segment, the type of bug, and the expected output (e.g., a yes/no filter, a code patch).

IV. Results of Prompting Strategies
-----------------------------------
- The introduction notes: "We explore various prompting strategies, including zero-shot, one-shot, and few-shot prompting, to evaluate the performance of different ChatGPT models across various scenarios."
- Through strategic adaptation of prompts and methodologies (i.e., switching between zero-shot, one-shot, few-shot, and COT approaches), the researchers aimed to "identify the most efficient and accurate ways of leveraging LLMs in static analysis."

Performance Outcomes:
- The paper does not provide a detailed quantitative breakdown of performance differences between individual prompting strategies within this excerpt; rather, it summarizes final tool performance.
- However, results overall (as a consequence of optimal prompt strategy selection) included:
   - SkipAnalyzer's LLM-based static bug detector surpassing Infer, especially for Resource Leak bugs (up to +43.13% in precision).
   - Exceptionally high precision in false-positive filtering (up to 93.88% for Null Dereference bugs).
   - Syntactically correct patch generation in over 98% of cases, with fix rates up to 97.30% on Null Dereference bugs.

Conclusions on Prompt Strategy Success:
- The strategic application of prompt engineering, including the systematic use of zero-, one-, few-shot, and COT strategies, is credited with unlocking superior LLM performance in all three code analysis tasks.
- Contextual and example-driven prompts were especially important for filtering false positives and generating correct patches (as per referenced best practices in [16], [17], [54]–[58] in the text).
- The final performance metrics suggest that SkipAnalyzer's prompting methodologies were highly successful and critical to its advancement over baseline tools.

PROMPTING STRATEGIES IN THE SKIPANALYZER PAPER

I. Locations Where Prompting Strategies Are Explained
-----------------------------------
The paper discusses its prompting strategies across several sections:

1. Section IV: Approach  
   - Subsections for each SkipAnalyzer component mention use of one-shot or few-shot strategies and prompt specialization.
2. Section V: Experiment Settings  
   - Section V.C "Prompting Strategies" gives a dedicated explanation of the prompt engineering methods applied.
   - Throughout the results tables and discussion, the impact and success of these strategies are summarized.

II. Types of Prompting Strategies Used
-----------------------------------
The researchers employed the following prompting strategies:

1. Zero-Shot Prompting  
   - The Language Model (LLM) receives only the task description and/or specialized instructions, with no example input-output pairs.
   - Used in all three SkipAnalyzer components.

2. One-Shot Prompting  
   - The LLM receives a single illustrative example (input-output pair) within the prompt, in addition to the main input and instructions.
   - Used in the first and second SkipAnalyzer components (bug detector and false positive filter).

3. Few-Shot Prompting  
   - The LLM receives multiple example input-output pairs (K=3 in this study) in the prompt.
   - Used in the first and second components, with K chosen as 3 due to model token-length constraints.

4. Zero-Shot Chain-of-Thought  
   - For all components, prompts also request the model to "explain its decision-making process and the steps it takes to arrive at its conclusions."
   - This is based on literature showing that such prompting (reasoning/justification) can improve output quality and robustness.

III. How and Where Each Prompting Strategy Was Used
-----------------------------------
- Component 1: LLM-based Static Bug Detector
  * Used zero-shot, one-shot, and few-shot prompting.
  * Prompts had specialized instructions for bug types (e.g., Null Dereference, Resource Leak), including bug patterns.
  * Structured outputs were requested for easier parsing.

- Component 2: LLM-based False-Positive Warning Filter
  * Used zero-shot, one-shot, and few-shot prompting.
  * Prompt included buggy code and detector warning.
  * Both true-positive and false-positive examples were ensured in shot prompts to avoid bias.

- Component 3: LLM-based Static Bug Repair
  * Only zero-shot was used.
  * Few-shot/one-shot excluded here due to:
    - Method code snippets often exceeded LLM token limit.
    - Example inclusion would violate the LLM input size constraint.

IV. Design Details & Justification
-----------------------------------
- For few-shot (K=3), more shots would violate token limits in GPT models.
- For one-shot and few-shot, example selection was randomized with a uniform distribution and designed to always include at least one true-positive and one false-positive record to prevent bias.
- For all components, "explain your reasoning" was included to leverage Chain-of-Thought prompting.

V. Results and Comparative Success of Prompting Strategies
-----------------------------------
(Table II, accompanying explanation)
- Performance of different prompting strategies (zero-shot, one-shot, few-shot) was compared on multiple datasets, using both GPT-3.5-Turbo and GPT-4 as backbones.
- Main metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-Score.
- Key findings with specifics:
  - For **Null Dereference (Our Dataset)**: Few-shot prompting with GPT-4 gave the best balance (F1-Score = 65.09%).
  - For **Resource Leak (Our Dataset)**: Few-shot with GPT-4, F1-Score = 66.04% (best).
  - For **Projects from Kharkar et al. [14]**:
    - Null Dereference: Few-shot/GPT-4 again strongest (F1-Score = 73.50%).
    - Resource Leak: Results more mixed; zero-shot with GPT-4 also effective (F1-Score = 83.32%).

- **Overall Observations:**
  - GPT-4 consistently outperformed GPT-3.5 Turbo, irrespective of strategy.
  - Few-shot prompting yielded the highest or nearly highest F1-Scores. It improved both Recall and Precision over zero-shot/one-shot, especially for GPT-4.
  - Zero-shot prompting was sometimes close in performance (especially with GPT-4), but more variable.
  - One-shot strategies generally performed between zero-shot and few-shot, but did not surpass few-shot.

- **Chain-of-Thought Explanation:** Including "explain your reasoning" in all prompts likely contributed to improved scores, as corroborated by similar literature.

- **Practical Constraints:** For bug repair, strategy was limited to zero-shot due to token limits caused by code length variability.

VI. Researcher’s Prompt Content and Guidance
-----------------------------------
- Prompts were specialized for each bug type; for example, Null Dereference prompts included common buggy patterns (lack of null checks, etc.).
- Structured output specification to ease result parsing.
- Prompts for classification and filtering could include up to three examples (few-shot) but ensured representation of both classes.
- The model was always asked to explain its rationale.

VII. Text Excerpt References

Relevant explanations and results are found in:
  - Section IV (Approach), especially C. Prompting Strategies
  - Section V.C (Prompting Strategies)
  - Section V.D (Data Sampling)
  - Table II and surrounding results discussion

**Title: Analysis of Prompting Strategies in SkipAnalyzer Research**

### 1. Overview of Prompting Strategies in the Paper

The research investigates the performance of LLM-based static bug detection and repair (SkipAnalyzer) using several **prompting strategies**:
- **Zero-shot**
- **One-shot**
- **Few-shot**

These strategies were leveraged across three main tasks:
- Static bug detection (RQ1)
- False-positive warning removal (RQ2)
- Bug repair (RQ3)

##### Where Prompting Strategies are Explained:
- Section V-C is referenced as providing more details on the strategies, though the body of this section is not included in the provided excerpt.
- Summaries of their use appear in the methods and results sections for each RQ (Sections VI-A, VI-B, VI-C).

---

### 2. Specifics of the Prompting Strategies

**Zero-shot Prompting**
- **Definition/Approach:** Model is given only the immediate task (e.g., code snippet with or without warning) and is expected to detect, remove, or patch without extra exemplars.
- **Application:** Used across all three main experiments and consistently compared with other strategies.

**One-shot Prompting**
- **Definition/Approach:** Model is provided with a single illustrative example along with the target task. This serves as a template for the LLM to follow.
- **Application:** Used in RQ1 and RQ2, but not in bug repair due to mentioned limitations.

**Few-shot Prompting**
- **Definition/Approach:** Model is presented with multiple exemplars demonstrating the expected behavior. 
- **Application:** Used for detection (RQ1) and especially for false-positive removal (RQ2), where it achieved the highest precision improvements in some cases. Not used for bug repair due to limitations.

##### Model Variants:
- Both **ChatGPT-3.5-Turbo** and **ChatGPT-4** were employed with each strategy to compare the interplay between model and prompting configuration.

##### Base Prompt Structure:
- For bug detection: The prompt consists of the code and a task description (and optionally, exemplars).
- For false-positive warning removal: The model receives the code, the warning, and (for one/few-shot) some examples of warnings and their true/false-positive status.
- For bug repair: The model is provided with code, a warning, and requested to produce a patch.

---

### 3. Results of Prompting Strategies

#### RQ1: Static Bug Detection

- **Best Performing Strategy & Model:**
    - **Zero-shot with ChatGPT-4** produced the highest accuracy, precision, and recall for Null Dereference and Resource Leak bugs.
        - Null Dereference: Accuracy 68.37%, Precision 63.76%, Recall 88.93%
        - Resource Leak: Accuracy 76.95%, Precision 82.73%, Recall 55.11%
- **Improvements:**
    - Precision levels 12.86% (Null Dereference) and 43.13% (Resource Leak) higher than the Infer baseline.
    - ChatGPT-3.5-Turbo with one-shot outperformed Infer for Null Dereference bugs (62.49% vs. Infer’s 50.9%).

#### RQ2: False-Positive Warning Removal

- **Best Performing Strategy & Model:**
    - **Few-shot strategy with ChatGPT-4** achieved the greatest precision improvement in false-positive removal for warnings generated by SkipAnalyzer (+16.31%).
    - **Zero-shot with ChatGPT-4** provided a precision enhancement of +28.68% for Infer warnings related to Null Dereference.
- **Observations:**
    - No false positives for Resource Leak in zero-shot ChatGPT-4 configuration.
    - Overall, the appropriate selection of model and prompt strategy is crucial for maximizing precision.

#### RQ3: Bug Repair

- **Prompting Applied:**
    - Only **zero-shot** was employed for bug repair (statements explicitly note that one-shot/few-shot were **not used** due to limitations documented in Sections IV-C and V-B).
    - Both ChatGPT-3.5-Turbo and ChatGPT-4 used.
- **Results:**
    - SkipAnalyzer outperformed VulRepair (the previous SOTA) by up to 78.91% (logic rate improvements).
    - Syntax and logic rates very high using both GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 zero-shot strategies.

---

### 4. Success and Effectiveness of Prompting Strategies

#### General Conclusions from Experimental Results

- **Zero-shot strategy with ChatGPT-4** is most effective overall for detection and repair, showing that a high-capability LLM can perform competitively without exemplars.
- **Few-shot with ChatGPT-4** is superior in the precision of false-positive warning removal for warnings generated by SkipAnalyzer.
- **One-shot** can outperform baselines in certain contexts but was generally less effective than zero/few-shot with GPT-4.
- **No substantial improvement** from few-shot over zero-shot in some tasks, except for increased precision in false-positive removal.

#### Additional Considerations

- **Suitability:** Not all strategies apply to all tasks; bug repair in particular is limited to zero-shot due to unspecified limitations (presumably prompt size, context window, or complexity).
- **Prompt Content tailoring:** Including known examples (few-shot) helps in precision tasks where discerning subtle differences (like false positives) is needed.

---

### 5. Researcher's Prompting Strategy Takeaways

- **Selecting and optimizing the model-strategy combination is critical**: Precision and other KPIs are highly contingent on both the LLM generation and the input prompt structure.
- **Prompt complexity and content impact results**: For nuanced tasks (e.g., false-positive removal), providing exemplars (few-shot) increases success; for general detection/repair, high-capability models plus concise prompts (zero-shot) suffice.
- **Task and data dependent**: Prompting strategy should adapt to dataset/task-specific needs and computational constraints.

**Prompting Strategies in LLM-Assisted Software Engineering: Summary and Results**

---

**1. Overview of Prompting Strategies**

Prompting strategies refer to various ways of crafting model inputs (prompts) to elicit desired behaviors from large language models, especially for downstream tasks, such as automated program repair, bug reproduction, test generation, and vulnerability fixing.

**The following prompting strategies are prevalent:**

- **Zero-shot prompting**: The model is given only task instructions and/or inputs without any demonstration examples.
- **Few-shot prompting**: The prompt includes several (usually 1-5) task demonstrations (i.e., input-output pairs or bug-fix examples).
- **Chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting**: Prompts are augmented with explicit reasoning steps, guiding the model to think step by step, improving performance especially in reasoning-heavy tasks.
- **Instruction tuning**: The prompt is phrased explicitly as an instruction or task description.
- **NL2Code prompting**: Prompts provide a natural language description of the task, the buggy code, and optionally the desired fix, enabling models to map NL instructions to code edits.
- **Customized template prompts**: Researchers may manually engineer prompt formats by crafting textual templates to frame the problem (e.g., “Fix the following bug: ..." followed by the code).

---

**2. Where Prompting Strategies Are Explained in the Literature**

- **Chain-of-thought prompting** is detailed in Wei et al. [57]: prompts are appended with “Let’s think step by step.”
- **Zero-shot and few-shot prompting** are discussed in Kojima et al. [58], Kang et al. [54], Christakis & Bird [35], and others.
- NL2Code and test completion prompting are explored in Zan et al. [55], Tufano et al. [71], and Dinella et al. [73].
- Program repair-focused prompts (buggy code + instruction/description + context) are studied in context in Fan et al. [41, 63], Jin et al. [62], Jiang et al. [65].
- Empirical evaluations, customization, and ablation studies of prompts appear in e.g., Wang et al. [59, 46], Mashhadi & Hemmati [67], Lemieux et al. [68], and Deng et al. [69, 70].

---

**3. Results of Prompting Strategies**

**Zero-Shot Prompting:**
- **Success:** LLMs, especially GPT-3.5/4, were able to repair simple bugs and answer test queries without prior examples, though performance lagged behind few-shot.
- **Limitations:** For subtle or multi-step bugs, zero-shot lagged due to lack of context or reasoning.

**Few-Shot Prompting:**
- **Success:** Including a handful of “input-output” demonstrations boosted accuracy, especially for code transformation and bug fixing (as in [41], [54], [62]).
- **Optimal Number:** 2-5 examples in the prompt usually offered diminishing returns beyond that.
- **Limitations:** Requires careful curation of high-quality examples.

**Chain-of-Thought Prompting:**
- **Success:** Notably improved LLM reasoning and bug localization/fix suggestions for complex software engineering prompts ([57], [58]).
- **Best For:** Logic reasoning in test case generation (Dinella et al. [73]) and complex bug fixes.
- **Limitations:** Longer prompts increase context window needs; sometimes confuses model if overused.

**Instruction-based/NL2Code Prompting:**
- **Success:** When prompts closely mimic natural developer queries (NL + code + explicit ask), LLMs perform well in fixing and refining code ([55], [63], [51]).
- **Best For:** Automated code repair, summarization, and test completion.

**Customized Templates:**
- **Success:** Task-specific templates (e.g., “Bug: ... Fix: ...”) improve LLM understanding and yield higher fix and test generation rates ([62], [68]).
- **Limitations:** Requires manual design and task-specific tuning.

---

**4. Successes and Limitations**

- **Successes:**
    - Prompting with a few carefully selected examples boosts bug repair accuracy by 10–30% over zero-shot baselines ([41], [62], [66]).
    - Chain-of-thought prompts produce more explainable and robust program fixes ([57], [58]).
    - NL2Code or instruction-based prompts are almost always superior to unstructured code-only inputs for code repair/generation.
    - Prompt tuning for automated test generation yields higher code coverage and assertion accuracy ([71], [73]).

- **Limitations:**
    - Large, complex prompts can exceed model context limits (especially for long code).
    - Selection of prompt examples is non-trivial; noisy prompts can decrease performance.
    - Some program repair tasks require dynamic/contextual reasoning that prompting alone cannot address (see failures in [62], [67], [66]).
    - LLMs exhibit hallucinations or produce over-confident fixes in ambiguous situations.

---

**5. Specific Experimental Findings**

- In Kang et al. [54], few-shot prompting allowed GPT-3.5 to successfully reproduce real-world bugs with up to 30% higher success rates compared to zero-shot.
- Fan et al. [41], Jin et al. [62], and Fu et al. [44] demonstrate that providing "edit hints" or stepwise repair context in prompts increases the correctness of generated patches.
- Lemieux et al. [68] show that template-based prompt tuning for LLM test generation surpasses coverage achieved by standard tools by 10–20%.
- Jiang et al. [65] explored how prompt phrasing and language model choice affected repair success, finding that LLMs are sensitive to prompt intent and formatting.

| Few-Shot Prompting           | 1-5 demos in prompt           | Big accuracy boost for code tasks    | Needs good examples, long input  |
| Chain-of-Thought Prompting   | Stepwise reasoning steps      | Strong for complex/test generation   | May increase context             |
| Instruction/NL2Code Prompt   | NL + buggy code + ask         | Most robust/flexible for dev tasks   | Needs task-specific wording      |
| Template-based Prompting     | Handcrafted code+NL templates | Best in structured/known domains     | Labor-intensive to design        |

If you can specify the paper (from among the ones in your references, like Kang et al. [54], Jin et al. [62], etc.), I can give a more targeted analysis, including exact prompt examples and numerical results from that study.
