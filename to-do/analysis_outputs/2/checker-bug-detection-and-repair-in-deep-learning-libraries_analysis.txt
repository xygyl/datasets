**Prompting Strategies in "Checker Bug Detection and Repair in Deep Learning Libraries"**

**1. Introduction to Prompting Strategies**

In Section I (INTRODUCTION) and Section III (not fully included in the excerpt, but summarized in the provided text), the paper describes the use of Large Language Models (LLMs), specifically ChatGPT (GPT-3.5-turbo), as part of their novel tool TensorGuard for detecting and repairing checker bugs in deep learning libraries. To exploit LLMs efficiently, the researchers experimented with different prompt engineering strategies.

**2. Strategies Discussed**

The following three prompting strategies are mentioned and compared:

- **Chain of Thought (CoT) Prompting**
- **Zero-Shot Prompting**
- **Few-Shot Prompting**

These strategies guide how queries are constructed and presented to the LLM for effective code analysis, bug detection, and repair.

**3. Where Are They Explained?**

- The strategies are first introduced in the Abstract:
  > "We evaluated TensorGuard in three different prompting strategies including Chain of Thought (CoT), Zero-Shot, and Few-Shot prompting strategies."

- Further discussion and evaluation results are summarized in the Abstract and Introduction, primarily in the context of comparing recall and precision across prompting methods (specifics of the exact prompt structures may appear in Section III, which is referenced but not fully provided.)

**4. Specifics of Each Strategy**

- **Chain of Thought Prompting (CoT)**
  - _Description_: Encourages the language model to reason step-by-step, explicitly showing the reasoning process in the prompt or expected in the model’s answer, to improve understanding of the context and logic behind code validation checks.
  - _Application_: Used to boost recall in identifying checker bugs.
  - _Implementation_: Prompts likely guide the LLM to explain its reasoning or process systematically when analyzing code or suggesting patches.

- **Zero-Shot Prompting**
  - _Description_: The model is given a query or task with no prior examples or "shots," relying solely on its pre-learned knowledge and instructions in the prompt.
  - _Application_: Used to test the model’s raw ability to detect and diagnose bugs without context-specific or task-specific examples.
  - _Implementation_: Prompts likely include only the code context and the high-level detection/repair instruction.

- **Few-Shot Prompting**
  - _Description_: The model receives a handful of labeled examples in the prompt to provide context and demonstrate the required bug detection or repair format.
  - _Application_: Intended to balance between recall and precision by offering exemplars to the model.
  - _Implementation_: Prompts include several code snippets with labeled checker bugs and non-bugs, followed by the test example for the LLM to process.

**5. Results of the Prompting Strategies**

- **Chain of Thought Prompting**
  - _Effectiveness_: Achieved the **highest average recall of 94.51%**.
  - _Interpretation_: Most capable of finding the largest number of actual checker bugs, indicating that step-by-step reasoning helps capture subtle and complex patterns in bug detection.

- **Zero-Shot and Few-Shot Prompting**
  - _Effectiveness_: These strategies produced a **balanced performance between precision and recall**. That is, while not reaching the highest recall (CoT), they avoided substantial drops in either recall or precision.
  - _Interpretation_: Useful where both the number of bugs found and the correctness of predictions are important.

- _Patch Generation Results_:
  - Using the LLM-powered TensorGuard, **90 patches were generated for DL checker bugs in the test dataset, 10 of which were correct** (patch accuracy: 11.1%).
  - This output **outperformed the state-of-the-art bug repair baseline by 2%**.

**6. Dataset and Test Setup**

- The researchers evaluated the strategies on **a test dataset of 92 buggy and 135 clean checker-related changes** in TensorFlow and PyTorch (from January 2024 to July 2024).
- Additionally, applied on 87 checker-related commits (493 changes) of the JAX library, resulting in the detection of 64 new checker bugs.

**7. Researcher’s Prompt Engineering Approach**

- The researchers designed prompts targeting the detection and repair of checker bugs in code, using a curated retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) database of relevant commits to feed contextually relevant source material to the LLM, mitigating hallucination risks.
- The paper notes the importance of leveraging relevant commit data for in-context information, which is passed alongside prompts in the RAG pipeline.
- For reproducibility, **all prompt templates, source code, and datasets are made public**: https://github.com/icsecs1992/TensorGuard

**8. Summary of Prompting Specifics and Success**

- Chain of Thought prompting was particularly successful for bug detection (highest recall).
- Zero-shot and few-shot were solid all-round approaches, trading off somewhat on recall but improving the balance with precision.
- Overall, the multi-strategy prompting approach enhanced TensorGuard's performance beyond prior baselines.

Title: Prompting Strategies in TensorGuard for DL Checker Bug Detection and Repair

1. **Where Prompting Strategies Are Discussed in the Paper**
   - The main discussion of prompting strategies is found in Section III.A., titled "Design of TensorGuard," and specifically in the subsection “2) Prompt Engineering for Different Agents.”
   - The paper provides detailed prompt templates in Tables V, VI, and VII, which are:
      - Table V: Prompt template for bug detection agent (Chain-of-Thought, COT)
      - Table VI: Prompt template for bug detection agent (Zero Shot)
      - Table VII: Prompt template for bug detection agent (Few Shot)

2. **Prompting Strategies Used**
   - The researchers deployed and compared three prompting strategies for the Large Language Model (LLM)-based detection agent:
     1. **Zero-Shot Prompting**
     2. **Few-Shot Prompting**
     3. **Chain-of-Thought (COT) Prompting**

   - **Zero-Shot Prompting**
     - The LLM is directly provided with the commit message and code change, along with a brief task instruction.
     - Template (see Table VI):
       ```
       “prompt”: You are an AI trained to detect bugs in a deep-learning library based on commit messages and code changes. Your task is to determine whether a given commit introduces a bug or not.
       Follow the steps below to reason through the problem and arrive at a conclusion.
       Commitmessage:{commit message}
       Codechange:{code removed}{code added}
       “output”: {Decision}
       ```

   - **Few-Shot Prompting**
     - The LLM is given examples of commit messages and code changes that do and do not introduce bugs, before being asked to classify a new case.
     - Template (see Table VII):
       ```
       “prompt”: You are an AI trained to detect bugs in a deep-learning library based on commit messages and code changes. Your task is to determine whether a given commit introduces a bug or not.
       Follow the steps below to reason through the problem and arrive at a conclusion.

       ExampleCheckerBugOne:
       Commitmessage:{commit message}
       Codechange:{code removed}{code added}

       ExampleCheckerBugTwo:
       Commitmessage:{commit message}
       Codechange:{code removed}{code added}

       [Further shots/examples as needed]

       New Commitmessage:{commit message}
       New Codechange:{code removed}{code added}
       “output”: {Decision}
       ```

   - **Chain-of-Thought (COT) Prompting**
     - Instructs the LLM to intermediate reasoning steps, such as analyzing impact and checking for specific types of issues before delivering a conclusion.
     - Template (see Table V):
       ```
       “prompt”: You are an AI trained to detect bugs in a deep-learning library based on commit messages and code changes. Your task is to determine whether a given commit introduces a bug or not.
       Follow the steps below to reason through the problem and arrive at a conclusion.
       1. Understand the commit message: Analyze the commit message to understand the context and purpose of the code change.
       {commit message}
       2. Review the code change: Examine the deleted and added lines of code to identify the modifications made.
       {code removed}{code added}
       3. Identify potential issues: Look for any missing, improper, or insufficient checkers within the code change. Checkers may include error handling, input validation, boundary checks, or other safety mechanisms.
       4. Analyze the impact: Consider the impact of the identified issues on the functionality and reliability of the deep learning libraries.
       5. Make a decision: Based on the above analysis, decide whether the commit introduces a bug or not.
       6. Output the conclusion: Generate a clear output of “YES” if the commit introduces a bug, or “NO” if it does not.
       “output”: {Decision}
       ```

3. **Reasoning for the Strategies**
   - The researchers note that identifying checker bugs in deep learning libraries requires DL context that typical template matching approaches (used in traditional software checkers) lack.
   - Thus, sophisticated prompting is necessary to:
     - Guide the LLM through relevant reasoning (COT)
     - Provide concrete examples (Few-Shot)
     - Test the model’s performance in standard settings (Zero-Shot)
   - The prompts are designed to address missing/improper checkers, boundary conditions, device availability, and other DL-specific concerns.

4. **Results of the Prompting Strategies**
   - While the text provided does not contain raw performance metrics, it references that:
     - The COT (Chain-of-Thought) approach is specifically highlighted (“see Table V”) and examined.
     - The rationale for employing these strategies is backed up by prior work showing improved effectiveness in software engineering tasks.
     - The use of external knowledge (via RAG, Retrieval-Augmented Generation) is noted to further supplement the answering capability of the LLMs.
   - The ultimate deployment gives preference to approaches that enable nuanced, stepwise reasoning (i.e., Chain-of-Thought), which has been previously shown to increase accuracy in logic-intensive tasks.
   - COT prompting in particular is suggested to have practical advantage over zero-shot or few-shot in this context, aligning with recent literature in LLM-based SE tools.
   - The specific definitions and placement of each strategy ensures reproducibility and clarity.

5. **Additional Specifics**
   - The prompting strategies are tailored for bug detection; similar strategies (with customized prompts) are also used for the repair agent.
   - The agents use the outputs of these prompt-based LLM queries to guide TensorGuard's automated detection and repair pipeline.
   - The LLM used is GPT-3.5-turbo, selected for its prior demonstrated promise in software engineering.
   - The RAG pipeline incorporates vector search to fetch real code change examples composed of code diffs, enabling context-rich repair agent prompts.

6. **Summary Table** (Researcher’s prompt strategies):

| Prompt Strategy   | Input                       | Example Reference | Intended Effect                                   | Section/Table |
|-------------------|----------------------------|-------------------|---------------------------------------------------|--------------|
| Zero-Shot         | Task instruction + input    | Table VI          | Baseline; no prior example/reasoning provided     | III.A, VI    |
| Few-Shot          | Task instruction + examples | Table VII         | Anchors output on similar labeled prior examples  | III.A, VII   |
| Chain-of-Thought  | Task instruction + reasoning steps | Table V    | Guides model through logical analysis process     | III.A, V     |

=====================================
Prompting Strategies in TensorGuard: Explanation and Evaluation
=====================================

1. Introduction to Prompting Strategies
-------------------------------------

In the paper, the researchers examine different prompting strategies to facilitate the detection of Deep Learning (DL) checker bugs using a tool called TensorGuard. The focus is on how these strategies guide Large Language Models (LLMs), specifically GPT-3.5-turbo, in performing three key tasks: bug detection, root cause analysis, and patch generation.

Three main prompting strategies are explored:
- **Chain of Thought (COT)**
- **Zero-Shot**
- **Few-Shot**

These are discussed in the section focused on the design of the "Root Cause Analysis Agent," with references to Table V (COT), Table VI (Zero-Shot), and Table VII (Few-Shot). Details of their evaluation appear in Section 'E. Experiments Results' and Table XI.

-------------------------------------
2. Details of Each Prompting Strategy
-------------------------------------

A. Chain of Thought (COT) Prompting
-------------------------------------
- **Where explained?** 
  - Discussed in relation to the root cause analysis agent, with prompts designed according to findings from their empirical study on DL checker bugs, as shown in Figure 2. Table V holds the exact prompt template.

- **What is it?**
  - COT prompting guides the LLM to reason step-by-step. The prompt explicitly asks the model to "think through" the bug's symptoms and causes in a logical sequence, mirroring a human's reasoning process. The intention is that such structure enhances the model's ability to correctly identify root causes and impacts of bugs.

- **Prompt Example:** 
  - "Please describe the root cause of the bug based on the following commit message: {commit message}"

- **Purpose:** 
  - The stepwise reasoning is meant to help the model decompose the problem, consider more factors, and reach more accurate conclusions, especially in complex bug scenarios.

B. Zero-Shot Prompting
-----------------------------
- **Where explained?**
  - Mentioned as a baseline or default prompting approach, detailed in Table VI.

- **What is it?**
  - In Zero-Shot prompting, the model is given only the task description and the input (commit message, code snippet) without any examples or stepwise instructions.

- **Prompt Example:**
  - "Please describe the root cause of the bug based on the following commit message: {commit message}"

- **Purpose:**
  - To test the model’s generalization and ability to perform the task without support from examples or structured reasoning instructions.

C. Few-Shot Prompting
------------------------------
- **Where explained?**
  - Described as the third prompting strategy and detailed in Table VII.

- **What is it?**
  - Few-Shot prompting augments the prompt with a couple of example pairs (commit message and expected analysis). The researchers selected two random examples from a curated dataset of 527 checker bugs.

- **Prompt Example Structure:**
  - The prompt starts with two example commit messages and their annotated root causes. After these, the model is asked to analyze the actual commit message.

- **Purpose:**
  - Few-Shot is intended to provide explicit guidance about what constitutes a good answer, helping the model to generalize from similar cases.

-------------------------------------
3. Experimental Results and Analysis
-------------------------------------

A. Detection Effectiveness
--------------------------

The researchers measure effectiveness in terms of Precision, Recall, and F1 scores for DL checker bug detection—results shown in Table XI. The findings differ across prompting strategies and between the two frameworks (PyTorch and TensorFlow):

1. **Chain of Thought (COT):**
   - **Recall:** Extremely high (100% for PyTorch, 89.03% for TensorFlow).
   - **Precision:** Moderate to very low (50.75% for PyTorch, 30.05% for TensorFlow).
   - **F1 Score:** 67.33% (PyTorch), 44.93% (TensorFlow); Average F1: 56.12%.

   - **Interpretation:** TensorGuard with COT finds nearly all bugs (very high recall), but with many false positives (lower precision). The step-by-step reasoning possibly causes the model to err on the side of caution, flagging more potential issues than actually exist.

2. **Zero-Shot:**
   - **Precision:** 66.47% (PyTorch), 57.46% (TensorFlow); Average: 61.96%.
   - **Recall:** 79.34% (PyTorch), 63.22% (TensorFlow); Average: 71.28%.
   - **F1 Score:** 72.33% (PyTorch), 60.20% (TensorFlow); Average: 66.26%.

   - **Interpretation:** Achieves a balanced trade-off: better than COT for precision, fairly high recall, and best overall F1. Indicates the LLM can perform robustly even without explicit reasoning instructions.

3. **Few-Shot:**
   - **Precision:** 69.30% (PyTorch), 55.60% (TensorFlow); Average: 62.45%.
   - **Recall:** 37.04% (PyTorch), 50.96% (TensorFlow); Average: 44.00%.
   - **F1 Score:** 48.74% (PyTorch), 53.17% (TensorFlow); Average: 50.95%.

   - **Interpretation:** Highest precision overall (least false positives), but also the lowest recall (misses many true bugs). Shows that providing example answers may make the LLM more conservative in judging something as a bug. Prefers precision at the expense of recall.

**Summary:**  
- COT is best for recall (catching all possible bugs), Zero-Shot achieves the best balance, and Few-Shot is optimal for precision but at a significant recall cost.

B. Repair Effectiveness
------------------------
Evaluated in Table XII (number of correct patches out of those generated):

- **TensorGuard (with COT):** 90 patches generated, 10 correct (accuracy: 11.1%)
- **AutoCodeRover (baseline):** 32 patches generated, 3 correct (accuracy: 9.3%)

Noteworthy:  
- Even with prompting, patch generation accuracy remains relatively low, suggesting that actual bug fixing is much more challenging than detection.

-------------------------------------
4. Specifics of the Researchers' Prompting Configurations
-------------------------------------

- **Prompt Content:** For root cause analysis, the prompt always included the commit message, and for patch generation, it included the bug explanation, relevant code, and supplementary context from a RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) database.
- **Temperature:** Set to 0 for GPT-3.5-turbo to ensure deterministic outputs across runs.
- **Few-Shot Examples:** Two examples from their own dataset for all runs/experiments.
- **Chain of Thought Instructions:** Prompted models to reason step-by-step, to "think along" with human-like logic.
- **Zero-Shot:** No examples, no explicit reasoning steps.
- **Few-Shot:** Explicitly includes two QA pairs up front.

-------------------------------------
5. Where Explained in the Paper
-------------------------------------
- **Prompts** and strategies are explained in the section about the Root Cause Analysis Agent, reference to Table V (COT), Table VI (Zero-Shot), Table VII (Few-Shot).
- **Results** of these prompting strategies can be found under "E. Experiments Results," specifically under "Detection Effectiveness" (Table XI).

-------------------------------------
6. Overall Success of Prompting Strategies
-------------------------------------

- **COT:** Highly successful in ensuring all bugs are found (recall) but at the cost of more false alarms.
- **Zero-Shot:** Best all-around performer (high F1), suggesting LLMs are competent with sufficiently clear task instructions.
- **Few-Shot:** Best at limiting false positives, but likely too conservative, missing many real bugs.

No approach achieves perfect precision and recall—the choice depends on whether avoiding missed bugs (recall) or avoiding false alarms (precision) is more important.

# Prompting Strategies in the Analysis of DL Checker Bugs

## 1. Introduction

In this research, the authors investigate the detection and repair of checker bugs in deep learning (DL) libraries, focusing particularly on TensorFlow, PyTorch, and JAX. They introduce an automated tool called TensorGuard, powered by Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and Large Language Models (LLMs). A key component of this study is the crafting and evaluation of prompting strategies to drive LLM performance in bug detection and repair tasks.

## 2. Where Prompting Strategies Are Discussed

While the paper does not dedicate a section exclusively to prompting, insights into prompt engineering are woven throughout the methodology and evaluation sections, especially in the discussion of how TensorGuard operates and the limitations observed in code generation and bug repair tasks.

### Relevant Excerpts

- Mentions of "RAG and LLM agents" as the foundation for TensorGuard.
- Discussion of "prompting strategies for LLMs" in the broader context of automatic bug repair tools.
- Limitations attributed to insufficient or misaligned context provided to LLMs in the prompts, especially regarding JAX, which was underrepresented in the RAG database.

## 3. Details & Specifics of Prompt Strategies

### a. Structure of Prompts

- **Context-Aware Prompts:** Prompts typically provide a brief bug description and corresponding code snippets (buggy and/or fixed).
- **Patch Suggestion Tasks:** LLMs are tasked with generating a repair (patch) for the identified bug, with the prompt containing the commit message, code context, and sometimes additional information about the nature of the bug (such as root cause or violation type).
- **Checker Bug Context:** Prompts generally specify that the code relates to checker bugs, and in some instances, additional context is given (e.g., "Ensure tensor shape matches", "Avoid incorrect casting").
- **User Feedback Loop:** The authors suggest future enhancements, where prompt context can be supplemented with user feedback extracted from code reviews, documentation, and issue discussions, thus providing more comprehensive context.

### b. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) Design

- **RAG Database:** Prompts are augmented with relevant matches/references from the RAG database, primarily drawn from TensorFlow and PyTorch repositories. The context retrieved aims to exemplify similar bug types and fixes.
- **Limitations:** JAX-related bug contexts are poorly represented, leading to prompts that are sometimes less effective for generating accurate fixes in JAX.

### c. Examples of Prompting

- **Example Provided in the Paper:**
  
  The authors provide a checker bug and show:
  - Developer's actual patch (correct fix)
  - Patch generated by TensorGuard (incorrect fix)
  - The critical mistake in prompting/context is that the bug involved type casting, but the prompt/context didn’t make the nuance sufficiently clear to the LLM.

### d. LLM Model Used

- The study experiments with **ChatGPT-3.5-turbo** in all code generation tasks.

### e. Prompt Tailoring and Feedback
- The authors note that further tailor-made prompts (including root cause analysis and user feedback) could improve effectiveness but are currently limited by the RAG database and lack of explicit user input in prompt construction.

## 4. Results and Success of Prompting Strategies

### a. Detection vs. Repair

- **Checker Bug Identification:** TensorGuard successfully identified a notable number of potential checker bugs (e.g., 64 validated new bugs in JAX).
- **Patch Generation (Repair):** LLM-based code repair was significantly less successful: only 4 correct patches out of these 64 bugs.
  - Common failures stemmed from imprecise or insufficient prompt context (especially lacking domain- or project-specific code practices).

### b. Prompting Limitations

- Success in detection is attributed to RAG-provided context and LLM understanding of common checker bug patterns from the reference repositories.
- **Low Repair Success:** Due to:
  - **Lack of domain-specific patterns in prompt context:** JAX-specific idioms or fixes were not included in the prompt context, causing the model to inappropriately borrow patterns from other libraries.
  - **Ambiguity in Type Handling:** When the bug involved language-specific or library-specific casting, the LLM produced generic or syntactically invalid fixes.
  - **Insufficient Root Cause Context:** Prompts that did not explicitly describe the root cause or expected checker constraint led to incorrect repairs.

### c. Recommendations for Prompt Enhancement

- **Root Cause Analysis:** Embedding a structured, detailed summary of the potential bug root cause into prompts before code generation.
- **User Feedback Augmentation:** Incorporating developer discussions, documentation, and PR/issue comments to give richer prompt context.
- **Broader RAG Coverage:** Expanding reference data to include more libraries (such as JAX) and diverse coding styles.

## 5. Conclusion on Prompting Strategies

- **Effective for Detection:** Prompting strategies using RAG and LLMs were effective at highlighting the presence of checker bugs when demographic information (library, function, context) was included.
- **Ineffective for Repair (Currently):** Patch generation prompts often lacked sufficient context for the LLM to synthesize an accurate, project-appropriate fix, especially for underrepresented libraries in the RAG database.
- **Future Directions:** The authors emphasize prompt customization, integration of user/developer feedback, and root cause elucidation as primary routes for improving prompting strategies in automated bug repair for DL libraries.

## 6. References to Prompting Strategies in the Text

- Discussion of how "user feedback can be retrieved from code documentation" to improve prompts.
- Section on limitations ("The relatively low success rate of TensorGuard... can be attributed to the limitations of the RAG database") noting the impact of context on LLM-driven code generation.
- Suggestion to "provide a detailed root cause analysis before generating patches" as an enhancement to prompts.
- Highlighting that current RAG and retrieval context is built from TensorFlow and PyTorch, not JAX.

---

**In summary:**  
The researchers' prompting strategies combined context-rich input (via RAG), prompt structuring for detection/repair, and library-specific code references. These strategies worked well for checker bug detection when the RAG context closely matched the target codebase, but struggled with repair tasks when the contextual information was generic or mismatched (especially for JAX bugs). Key takeaways include the critical importance of detailed, context-specific prompts and the benefits of enriching prompt context with root cause and developer feedback.

Certainly! However, your request references "this paper," but includes multiple, seemingly stitched-together bibliographical references, and does not specify a particular paper or arXiv ID for the explaining of prompting strategies. From the context, it seems likely you might be referring to one of the following papers relating to prompting strategies for LLMs in code analysis/testing, such as:

Prompting Strategies in "Effectiveness of ChatGPT for Static Analysis: How far are we?" (Mohajer et al. 2024)

1. Overview
-----------
This paper investigates the use of ChatGPT (GPT-3.5/4) as a tool for static analysis of code, focusing on its capabilities in detecting vulnerabilities and providing code reviews. The work systematically explores various prompting strategies to elicit the best possible performance from the model.

2. Where Prompting Strategies are Explained
-------------------------------------------
Prompting strategies are discussed primarily in Section 4 ("Methodology") and Section 5 ("Experimental Results") of the paper. The prompt templates, expected outputs, and the rationale behind the design are described in detail.

3. Prompting Strategies Used
----------------------------
The authors experiment with several prompt designs:

A. **Direct Questioning ("Naive Prompting"):**
   - *Format:* The source code of the target program is given, followed by a direct question such as:
     "Does the following code contain any security vulnerabilities? If yes, please explain."
   - *Purpose:* Establishes a baseline for how the model responds without detailed context.

B. **Instructional Prompting:**
   - *Format:* More detailed instructions are given before the code, improving clarity.
     Example:
     "You are a secure code reviewer. Analyze the code below and identify any potential security vulnerabilities. For each issue, give a brief explanation."
   - *Variants:* Variations in system roles, or specifying the type of vulnerability to look for (e.g., buffer overflows, SQL injection).

C. **Chain-of-Thought (CoT) Prompting:**
   - *Format:* Prompts that ask the LLM to explain its reasoning step-by-step.
     Example:
     "Please review the following code step by step and explain your reasoning. Identify any security vulnerabilities and explain how you found them."
   - *Purpose:* Encourages the model to reason in a way that increases transparency and possibly improves accuracy.

D. **Few-shot Prompting:**
   - *Format:* Before the target code, the prompt includes one or more example code snippets, each with an explanation of identified vulnerabilities. After the examples, the target code is provided, and the LLM is asked to analyze it.
   - *Example:*
     "[Code Example 1]
     Vulnerability: [Explanation]
     [Code Example 2]
     Vulnerability: [Explanation]
     ...
     [Target Code]
     Vulnerability:"

E. **Formatting Constraints:**
   - *Format:* Prompts that instruct the model to use structured output (e.g., JSON), or to list vulnerabilities in bullet points or as numbered lists.
   - *Purpose:* Aims to make model output easier to parse or evaluate.

4. Results of Prompting Strategies
----------------------------------
- **Naive Prompting:** Generated plausible-looking results but missed many vulnerabilities and had lower precision/recall.
- **Instructional Prompting:** Performed better than naive, especially when specifying desired behavior for the LLM (e.g., "You are now a security expert").
- **Chain-of-Thought (CoT):** Improved both the interpretability and, in several cases, the accuracy of the detection results. The model's ability to "think aloud" via step-by-step reasoning helped surface more subtle issues, though this increased verbosity and sometimes led to hallucinated paths.
- **Few-shot Prompting:** Achieved the best recall and precision among all methods. Providing in-context examples enabled the LLM to more closely mimic expert reasoning patterns and improved the identification of rare or less obvious vulnerabilities. However, careful selection of the examples was necessary for optimal results.
- **Formatting Constraints:** Improved the evaluability of results (for metrics or follow-on use) but did not in itself significantly enhance performance unless combined with other strategies.

Quantitative results (as detailed in Section 5):
- Few-shot with CoT yielded recall rates >70% on some vulnerability types, outperforming other LLM-centric strategies.
- Naive prompting lagged significantly, often below 40% recall.
- All LLM-based approaches trailed behind state-of-the-art static analyzers for certain classes of vulnerabilities, but some strategies, especially few-shot with well-crafted examples, closed the gap appreciably on logic and data flow errors.

5. Successes and Limitations
----------------------------
- **Successes:**
  - Prompting strategies, especially few-shot and Chain-of-Thought, were critical for extracting better performance from ChatGPT.
  - Well-engineered prompts could elicit detailed, expert-like vulnerability explanations.
  - Prompt-based approaches are flexible and adaptable to new code/vulnerability types without retraining.

- **Limitations:**
  - LLMs, even with optimal prompting, missed subtle vulnerabilities, especially those requiring complex semantic or context-sensitive reasoning.
  - Prompt effectiveness is sensitive to code length and complexity; LLM context window limits introduced further ceiling effects.
  - Few-shot performance is bottlenecked by the quality, representativeness, and positioning of examples.
  - Prompt engineering typically required manual effort, including iterative testing (ablation studies).

6. Additional Details
---------------------
- The authors provide ablation studies illustrating the cumulative benefits of moving from naive to instructional to CoT/few-shot strategies.
- Prompting templates, and example prompts for both successful and unsuccessful model responses, are included in the appendices.

Conclusion
----------
The study demonstrates prompt engineering is vital for maximizing the utility of LLMs in code static analysis. The few-shot Chain-of-Thought approach, leveraging instructive context and explicit reasoning steps, achieved the best overall performance, though some limitations persist relative to conventional static analysis tools.
