LLMDFA Prompting Strategies - Details Extracted from "LLMDFA: Analyzing Dataflow in Code with Large Language Models"

1. **Introduction to Prompting in LLMDFA**

The LLMDFA paper presents an LLM-powered framework for dataflow analysis that is compilation-free and customizable. A key challenge it addresses is reducing hallucinations in LLM results, especially for critical code reasoning tasks. The authors discuss prompting strategies as central to decomposing the overall problem into manageable LLM-invokable sub-problems.

Prompting is explicitly discussed in:
- Abstract, Sections 1 (Introduction), 3 (Method), and further detailed in Subsections 3.1-3.3.

2. **Prompting Strategy Overview**

LLMDFA decomposes the analysis into three sub-problems:
- Source/Sink Extraction
- Dataflow Summarization
- Path Feasibility Validation

Prompting strategies are adapted for each phase, focusing on:
- Delegating complex tasks to external tools where possible via LLM code synthesis prompts.
- Aligning LLM reasoning with code semantics using a "few-shot chain-of-thought (CoT)" prompting approach.

3. **Details of Prompting Strategies per Phase**

---

**A. Source/Sink Extraction (Section 3.1):**

- **Challenge:** LLMs hallucinate when directly asked if a line is a source/sink, and repeated queries are expensive.
- **Solution:** Prompt LLMs not to classify source/sink directly, but to *synthesize scripts* (parsers) that use parsing libraries to traverse the AST and extract sources/sinks.
    - Prompts define:
        - The *specification* S of sources/sinks (natural language description).
        - *Example programs* E with known sources/sinks and their ASTs T.
        - A *phase description* D₁, which includes the task requirement (e.g., “write a Python script that finds all variables that may be assigned zero”).
- **Prompting Process:** Script synthesis is formulated as conditional generation, followed by a feedback/fix loop (if initial script is incorrect, provide execution results, ask LLM for fixes).
- **Specifics:** The prompt includes 
    - Natural language description of what constitutes a source or sink (from the user/application).
    - Example code snippets with annotations (shown sources/sinks).
    - Example AST representations.
    - Request to generate Python code using a parsing library to extract nodes matching criteria.
- **Iteration:** If the script fails on examples, execution results are fed back to the LLM, and the prompt is updated to say what went wrong, leading to iterative corrections.
- **Advantages:** This method yields deterministic and explainable results and reduces hallucinations.

---

**B. Dataflow Summarization (Section 3.2):**

- **Challenge:** Summarizing dataflow facts inside a function accurately, especially given LLMs' context length limitations and hallucination tendencies.
- **Solution:** Use *few-shot chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting.*
    - *Few-Shot*: Provide several demonstrations (examples) of the desired analysis, mapping between code, possible variable dependencies, and dataflow facts.
    - *Chain-of-Thought*: In the demonstrations, explain the step-by-step reasoning process from variable assignment to dependence (e.g., “variable x is assigned from user input; z receives value x at line 10, so z depends on x”).
- **Prompt Content:**
    - Several short code snippets with line numbers.
    - For each, an annotated CoT reasoning from lines/dependencies to summary dataflow facts (variable@line → variable@line).
    - A new, similar code snippet for the LLM to analyze.
    - An explicit instruction for the output: first reason in steps, then summarize the dataflow facts in the required format.
- **Alignment:** This approach grounds the LLM in code semantics and process, mitigating hallucination.
- **Advantages:** Makes LLM less likely to skip steps or make illogical jumps. 
- **Caveat:** If insufficient or partially misleading demonstration examples are used, errors may propagate across functions.

---

**C. Path Feasibility Validation (Section 3.3):**

- **Challenge:** LLMs are weak at symbolic reasoning – e.g., validating logical path constraints for feasibility.
- **Solution:** Use LLMs as *code synthesizers*: prompt LLM to generate code that encodes appropriate logical formulae (based on collected path conditions) and uses an automated theorem prover/SAT solver (e.g., Z3) to assess feasibility.
    - The prompt includes:
        - A request to write a script that, given a set of path conditions (as strings or expressions), builds a formula expressing the conjunction of these conditions.
        - Instructions to output whether the formula is satisfiable.
        - Example input/output pairs.
- **Prompt Loop:** If the script fails or is incorrect, the error message/behavior is included in the next prompt, asking for fixes.
- **Advantages:** Pushes correctness concerns onto the expert system (the external solver), not the LLM, thus mitigating LLM hallucinations in logic.

---

4. **Summary of Prompting Strategy Principles**

- *Decomposition*: Break down complex analysis into simpler, targeted tasks.
- *Outsourcing*: For tasks involving syntax or hard symbolic logic, prompt LLM to generate code that calls reliable external tools (parsing libraries, SMT solvers).
- *Demonstration (Few-Shot)*: For in-context reasoning, provide several labeled examples, explicitly showing the reasoning chain.
- *Alignment*: Use prompts that force step-by-step reasoning to keep LLM outputs grounded in program semantics.

---

5. **Results of Prompting Strategies**

- **Source/Sink Extraction:** 
    - Synthesized extractors using prompt-engineered LLMs achieved deterministic behavior and high accuracy, by delegating tree-traversal to parsers.
    - Significantly reduced false positives/negatives versus direct LLM classification.

- **Dataflow Summarization:**
    - Few-shot CoT prompting enabled the LLM to achieve high fidelity in summarizing dataflow facts within function boundaries.
    - The LLM output was largely correct when exemplars were well-chosen and when code snippets were not too large for token limits.
    - Compared to baselines (e.g., CodeFuseQuery and naive end-to-end CoT prompting without decomposition), this method improved F1 scores substantially (0.23–0.36 improvements).

- **Path Feasibility Validation:**
    - By synthesizing code that calls SMT (Satisfiability Modulo Theories) solvers, the framework avoided the pitfalls of direct LLM logical reasoning, which is known to be unreliable (hallucination-prone).
    - This delegation permitted path-sensitive, low-false-positive analysis (e.g., not flagging unrealizable bugs as in the earlier motivating example).

- **Overall Success:**
    - Across three representative bug types (DBZ, XSS, OSCI) and on Android malware, the LLMDFA framework surpassed traditional and LLM-based baselines, achieving up to 87.10% precision and 80.77% recall.
    - The ablation and comparison results demonstrate that prompt decomposition and delegation (with exemplars for in-LLM reasoning) provide substantial advantages compared to monolithic LLM approaches.

---

6. **Limitations and Observations**

- Success depends on the quality of demonstration examples in few-shot prompts.
- Failure to properly iterate/fix synthesized extractor or validator scripts can result in extraction or validation errors.
- If the examples provided to the LLM are incomplete or misleading, errors may be learned and repeated.
- For very large codebases, context window limits pose challenges for few-shot CoT reasoning.

---

7. **Conclusion**

The LLMDFA prompting strategies rest on decomposing program analysis into narrowly focused LLM tasks, augmented by code synthesis to external, deterministic (non-LLM) tools, and demonstration-driven step-by-step reasoning. Their careful design, iterative correction, and outsized reliance on prompt engineering are demonstrated to be essential for outperforming both traditional compiled-code analyzers and end-to-end LLM approaches on real-world and synthetic code analysis tasks.

# Prompting Strategies in LLMDFA: Detailed Explanation

## 1. Overview

LLMDFA is a system designed for dataflow analysis in software, leveraging large language models (LLMs) for three key phases:
- Extraction (of sources and sinks)
- Dataflow summarization
- Path feasibility validation

Prompting strategies play a central role in enabling LLMs to perform these tasks accurately by guiding their reasoning, reducing hallucination, and improving alignment with program semantics.

---

## 2. Prompting Strategies and Their Placement in the Paper

### 2.1. Synthesized Extractor Prompts (Phase I: Extraction)
**Where discussed:** Introduction, Section 3.1, Figure 12 (Appendix A.2.3) (not shown in full in the excerpt), and reference to prompt template Figure 9 (Appendix A.2.2).

**Description:**
- Prompts are constructed to guide LLMs in extracting sources and sinks from program code.
- Extractors are synthesized once per bug type and can be reused across programs.
- Skeletons of extractor code are provided manually, with LLMs generating specific logic (highlighted in grey in the code).
- The prompt template details the structure for these prompts, ensuring consistent extraction methodology.

**Goal:** Minimize manual intervention and maximize reusability and precision in identifying sources and sinks, crucial for subsequent analysis phases.

---

### 2.2. Few-Shot Chain-of-Thought (CoT) Prompting (Phase II: Dataflow Summarization)
**Where discussed:** Section 3.2. Details in prompt template Figure 10 (Appendix A.2.2).

**Description:**
- Few-shot CoT prompts are used to align LLMs with the semantics of dataflow summarization.
- Prompts provide phase description D and a list of examples E, each example including detailed explanations and reasoning for the dataflow facts.
- The strategy is formalized as a conditional probability (Equation 4):  
  r ~ p(·| D, E_flow, v, v′, P)
- Prompts ask LLMs to reason step by step and output a Yes/No answer regarding the existence of dataflow facts, alongside an explanation (i.e., stepwise justification for each summarized fact).
- Examples within prompts explicitly illustrate typical dataflow patterns (assignments, direct uses, etc.), exposing reasoning chains and intermediate values—critical for model alignment and reducing hallucinations.

**Goal:**  
- Encourage systematic, explainable reasoning over code, mapping program variable flows accurately.
- Significantly reduce hallucinations and mistakes in dataflow conclusions due to clearer, example-driven reasoning structure.

---

### 2.3. Iterative Script Synthesis with Error-driven Fixes (Phase III: Path Feasibility Validation)
**Where discussed:** Section 3.3. Prompt template in Figure 11 (Appendix A.2.2).

**Description:**
- LLMs are prompted to synthesize Python scripts (using, e.g., Z3 SMT solver) that encode and solve path constraints derived from identified dataflow summaries.
- Synthesis is iterative:  
  - After the initial script is generated (α(0)), LLMs receive error messages from attempted executions as additional input for up to t rounds of refinement (Equations 5–7).
  - If correct script synthesis is not achieved in three rounds, LLMs fall back to directly reasoning about path feasibility using the available path information.
- The prompt includes specific structural instructions and path information, and (when applicable) error feedback for correction.

**Goal:** 
- Decouple constraint solving from path condition identification, reducing hallucination and allowing LLMs to leverage off-the-shelf reasoning tools (e.g., Z3).
- Achieve higher reliability in determining path feasibility through iterative, feedback-driven synthesis.

---

## 3. Results of Prompting Strategies

### 3.1. Quantitative Results
(Referencing Table 1 and discussion in Section 4.2):

- Extraction via synthesized extractor prompts: **100% precision and recall** across all LLMs and bug types.
- Few-shot CoT for summarization: 
  - Precision/Recall (gpt-3.5): DBZ 90.95/97.57, XSS 86.52/96.25, OSCI 89.57/85.76
- Validation via iterative synthesis: 
  - Precision/Recall (gpt-3.5): DBZ 81.58/99.20, XSS 100/100, OSCI 100/97.14

**Overall F1 scores for end-to-end detection with gpt-3.5:**
- DBZ: 0.82
- XSS: 0.96
- OSCI: 0.88

### 3.2. Comparisons & Ablation Results

#### Baselines:
- LLMDFA’s prompting beats industrial static analyzers (CodeFuseQuery, Pinpoint) in both precision and recall, particularly for complex bugs (DBZ, OSCI).
- LLM-based direct end-to-end analysis (not using multi-stage prompting) suffers from hallucinations and poor precision, especially for more complex patterns or infeasible paths.

#### Ablations (Section 4.4):
- **NoSynExt (Direct Extraction by Prompt Only):** Lower precision in source/sink extraction, resulting in more false positives.
- **NoCoT (No Chain-of-Thought):** Lower recall, especially for complex dataflows, as LLMs miss individualized patterns without stepwise prompt structure.
- **NoSynVal (Direct Path Validation by LLMs):** No significant superiority for OSCI/XSS (due to the nature of the benchmarks), but increases false positives in DBZ.
- **LLMDFA stands out in recall and F1 score**, demonstrating clear benefits from its targeted prompting strategies, especially in minimizing hallucinations.

#### Real-World Evaluation:
- On TaintBenchSuite (real-world Android malware apps), LLMDFA attained 75.38% precision and 61.25% recall on sampled dataflow paths.
- Main residual errors attributed to some remaining hallucination, mainly in summarization.

---

## 4. Specific Details on Research Prompting Practices

- All prompt templates (for extraction, summarization, validation) are modular and skeletonized for reusability, as shown in the referenced appendix figures.
- LLMDFA provides **few-shot, example-rich, and explanation-based prompts**—a best practice for LLM alignment on specialized code reasoning tasks.
- Synthesis-based prompting (for both extractors and validation scripts) leverages *iteration with error feedback*, enhancing robustness to model errors or ambiguities.
- Step-by-step reasoning is enforced in all phases, explicitly requesting justifications alongside outputs to reduce hallucinations.
- Prompts are constructed specifically for each bug type but designed for one-time definition/reuse, minimizing redundancy and manual labor.

---

## 5. Conclusions on Prompting Strategy Effectiveness

- **Highly effective in reducing hallucinations**—especially the few-shot CoT and synthesized script feedback approaches.
- LLMs achieve strong performance (precision/recall) versus static analyzers and direct LLM prompting baselines.
- Strategies generalize across LLMs and bug types, showing systematic improvement regardless of underlying model.
- Minor limitations remain in summarization for complex or highly varied real-world code, but the approach represents a significant advance over prior methodologies.

Prompting Strategies Used in the LLMDFA Paper: Summary and Evaluation

1. Where Prompting Strategies Are Discussed

Prompting strategies, particularly the use of few-shot Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting, are discussed in several parts of the paper. The strategies are first introduced conceptually in the methodology (Section 3, not directly shown in the provided content but referenced), and their practical evaluation is described in Section 4 (Evaluation/Results). The limitations and future improvements relating to prompting are addressed in Section 4.7. Comparisons to baseline prompting strategies are found in Section 4.5 and Table 3 (“Performance results upon TaintBench”).

2. Description and Specifics of Researcher’s Prompt Strategies

- **Few-shot Chain-of-Thought (CoT) Prompting**:  
  The key strategy for eliciting dataflow analysis reasoning from LLMs is few-shot CoT prompting. This method provides the LLM with multiple (“few-shot”) examples of dataflow reasoning tasks, each annotated step-by-step to encourage the model to produce intermediate reasoning and more reliable structured output, rather than hallucinated or shallow results.

- The CoT prompting breaks the overall dataflow analysis problem down into more easily managed sub-problems ("decomposes the whole analysis into three manageable sub-problems"), guiding the LLM through each stage. 

- The structure of prompts includes:
    - Tool synthesis (constructing small tools or routines in code)
    - Contextualized questions about dataflow facts between specific program variables
    - Request for step-by-step explanation or intermediate values (the “chain-of-thought”)
    - Formal-method-based validation questions to ensure logical consistency of the output

- For comparison, the researchers also tried:
    - **End-to-end Prompting**: Direct prompts to LLMs asking for a full analysis in one shot, optionally with a few examples, but without CoT or careful decomposition.
    - **Customized Queries for CodeFuseQuery**: Designed prompts/queries targeting dataflow specifically, leveraging that tool’s query system, but not necessarily using CoT or LLM open-ended reasoning.

3. Results of the Prompting Strategies

Results are reported in Table 3 for three settings:

- A1: LLMDFA with gpt-3.5 and few-shot CoT prompting (the main strategy)
- A2: End-to-end analysis with gpt-3.5, using standard/few-shot prompting but not CoT
- A3: CodeFuseQuery, using manually crafted queries

Performance Metrics:
Metric                | A1 (LLMDFA few-shot CoT) | A2 (End-to-end) | A3 (CodeFuseQuery)
----------------------|-------------------------|-----------------|---------------------
Precision             | 75.38%                  | 43.48%          | 72.92%
Recall                | 61.25%                  | 25.00%          | 43.75%
F1 Score              | 0.67                    | 0.32            | 0.55

Key Observations:
- Few-shot CoT prompting (A1) provides significantly better precision, recall, and F1 score compared both to end-to-end prompting (A2) and customized tool queries (A3).
- End-to-end prompting struggles particularly with recall (25%), as the LLM misses sources and sinks or makes inconsistent connections.
- CodeFuseQuery, while having reasonably high precision, suffers from low recall due to difficulty with complex code constructs (e.g., global variables, arrays).
- The breakdown and intermediate steps encouraged by CoT prompting clearly improve the stability and completeness of the LLM's answer.

4. Discussion of Success and Limitations

**Success:**
- The main outcome is that decomposed, step-wise CoT prompts help LLMs avoid “hallucinations” and reasoning failures that plague one-shot or monolithic prompts.
- LLMDFA's CoT approach was “customizable, compilation-free, and achieved remarkable performance” even on real-world codebases without access to intermediate representations (IR) from compilation.
- The structured prompting allowed high multi-language portability (Java, C/C++, JavaScript) with minimal code changes.

**Limitations:**
- **Prompt Length & Token Cost:** For large programs, the prompt becomes unwieldy and expensive for LLM inference.
- **Limited to Program Modules:** Whole-program analysis is currently impractical due to cost and latency.
- **Imprecision in Summarization:** The few-shot approach still struggles when summarizing very large functions or when advanced features such as pointers are in use, sometimes providing imprecise dataflow summaries.
- **Path Condition Encoding:** LLMDFA occasionally encodes infeasible or incorrect path conditions; prompt-based over-approximation patterns are suggested as a future fix.

**Potential Improvements Discussed:**
- Accelerate or parallelize inference for large-scale/whole-program analysis.
- Fine-tune LLMs on dataflow facts produced by classical analyzers.
- Devise new prompt synthesis methods to handle complex path conditions.

5. All Specifics of Prompt Strategies

- **Few-shot CoT Prompt Structure Example (inferred):**
    1. Provide a code excerpt.
    2. Instruct model: “Explain, step by step, the flow of data from source variable X to sink variable Y.”
    3. Include several sample analyses (few-shot) with their own reasoning steps.
    4. Request a summary or a structured dataflow graph as final output.
    5. Optionally, pose verification questions: “Is the above path feasible considering all conditionals?”
    6. Formal-method validation: Cross-check the LLM’s reasoning with SMT solver constraints or similar methods.

- **Contrast with End-to-End Prompting:**
    - End-to-end prompts skip the intermediate steps and just instruct: “Analyze the dataflow for this program and report all source-sink pairs.”
    - These lack guided reasoning and lead to “primarily affected by the incorrect identification of sources and sinks.”

- **Contrast with CodeFuseQuery Prompting:**
    - Use of explicit, hand-written queries specifying paths or relationships, tailored to the dataflow system’s query API.
    - These can miss more subtle paths, especially for dynamic/complex constructs.

6. Conclusion

- The LLMDFA’s few-shot CoT prompting strategy is the key innovation, delivering state-of-the-art LLM-powered dataflow analysis. Its stepwise breakdown, coupled with structured exemplars and validation, enables much more reliable and customizable program analysis vs. baseline prompting methods.

References for further details are Tables 3, 4, 5, Section 4.5 (Results/Comparison), and Section 4.7 (Limitations).

Prompting Strategies in LLMDFA for Dataflow Analysis

1. Introduction

The paper explores the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) for dataflow analysis, especially in software engineering tasks such as the detection of dataflow-related bugs (e.g., division-by-zero, "DBZ"). A key aspect of the methodology is the design of prompt templates to guide LLMs in synthesizing code, summarizing dataflows, and validating path feasibility. The appendix provides substantial detail about these strategies.

2. Where Prompting Strategies Are Explained

Prompting strategies are specifically discussed in the following sections of the appendix:
- A.2 Prompt of LLMDFA and Baseline (Prompt Design, Templates, Examples)
  - A.2.1 Prompt Design Principle of LLMDFA
  - A.2.2 Prompt Templates of LLMDFA
  - A.2.3 Example Program and Sink Extractor for DBZ Detection
- Figures 9, 10, and 11 illustrate the concrete prompt templates used.

3. Prompt Design Principles

Section A.2.1 describes the high-level goals and grounding behind the prompt engineering:
- Enumerating source/sink types based on bug definitions, primarily taking guidance from the Juliet Test Suite.
- Using varied illustrative examples to showcase common patterns in dataflow (direct use, assignment, load/store for pointers).
- For script synthesis (e.g., path feasibility validation), minimal examples are given—just a basic skeleton encouraging completion.

Key points:
- Prompts are intentionally simple and avoid assumptions requiring expert knowledge.
- Examples are consistently structured for easy copy-pasting and minor customization.
- The design reduces need for domain expertise or heavy manual effort.

4. Prompt Template Details

Templates (seen in Figures 9–11 of the appendix):

A. Source/Sink Extractor Synthesis (Fig 9)
- Role: LLM as a proficient programmer conversant with ASTs.
- Inputs: Specification of sources/sinks, example programs with ASTs.
- Task: Synthesize a Python script that traverses ASTs to extract sources/sinks.
- Fixing cycle: If errors are encountered or ground-truth mismatches occur, the prompt feeds back errors and instructs the LLM to revise the script.

B. Dataflow Summarization Prompts (Fig 10)
- Role: LLM as a skilled Java programmer.
- Task: Given examples and inference rules (e.g., value assignment, non-overwriting), determine if two variables at given lines refer to the same value.
- Style: Clear, stepwise explanations, with outputs always providing a Yes/No and justification.

C. Path Feasibility Validation (Fig 11)
- Role: LLM as a programmer experienced with Z3 Python binding.
- Task: Write a Python program to encode path constraints using Z3.
- Inputs: Path conditions, variable values, branch contexts.
- Fixing cycle: As with extraction, fixes are solicited if the code is not executable.

The prompts for other bug types follow similar structures.

5. Examples & Clarity

- All example code blocks for the tasks are concise, totaling no more than 6 lines each.
- An explicit, consistent sentence structure is used for explanations and outputs, making the approach easy to replicate.

6. Prompt Refinement via Iteration

In cases where the LLM’s initial output does not match expectations or contains errors (either runtime errors or incorrect extractions), the prompt is updated to include:
- The previous script
- The error message received
- Missed sources/sinks or wrongly identified variables

The LLM is asked to repair and re-output the corrected script, following a human-in-the-loop, feedback-guided refinement cycle.

7. Evaluation and Results

The effectiveness of the prompt strategies is discussed mainly in the broader impact and results sections (A.1, main paper, possibly Table/Results sections not included here):

Main conclusions about success:
- The LLM-powered approach to dataflow analysis, driven by the outlined prompt templates, enabled analysis across multiple programming language version differences and handled incomplete programs without heavy customization.
- LLMs could serve as program ‘semantics interpreters’, reducing the need for traditional abstraction and precision optimization required in conventional tools.
- The prompts required only minimal manual effort—the examples and templates were easy to generate and did not need deep expert engineering.

Limitations mentioned:
- Prompting beyond simple cases (examples up to 6 lines) and more complex, real-world programs may introduce challenges not fully captured here.
- Success is qualified by the paper’s own scope—efficiency, token costs, source code privacy, and more complex abstraction in traditional analysis tools still remain topics for future improvement.

8. Summary of Prompting Strategy Specifics

- Prompts are task-specific (extraction, summarization, validation).
- Each prompt includes relevant role-playing instructions, clear input-output format description, and illustrative examples.
- Prompts are accompanied by short, reproducible examples and structured explanations to foster output consistency.
- A refinement loop is implemented: the LLM is given the chance to repair its code outputs given runtime errors or misclassifications, further improving end-to-end analysis.

9. Conclusion

The prompting strategies in this paper are methodically designed for reproducibility, minimal manual intervention, and consistent output for dataflow analysis. The approach is grounded in clear, role-based prompting, concise examples, and interactive repair cycles. While highly effective within the paper’s experimental context, further work is needed to scale these results toward more intricate, real-world software artifacts.

LLMDFA PROMPTING STRATEGIES – DETAILED ANALYSIS
================================================

OVERVIEW
--------
LLMDFA (Large Language Model-driven DataFlow Analysis) leverages prompting strategies to drive code analysis, source/sink extraction, and path feasibility validation using state-of-the-art LLMs (GPT-3.5, GPT-4, Gemini-1.0, Claude-3). This strategy addresses the limitations of end-to-end LLM prompting by decomposing program analysis tasks and guiding LLM reasoning with carefully crafted prompts.

PROMPTING STRATEGIES – EXPLAINED
---------------------------------

A. Few-shot Chain-of-Thought (CoT) Prompting

- **Location/Explanation:**  
  See Appendix A.2.4, and references throughout Section A.3, particularly in “Prompt Design of LLM-based End-to-end Analysis.”
- **Description:**  
  LLMDFA employs few-shot CoT prompting: prompt templates include concise code snippets showing all forms of sources and sinks. Each such snippet represents a single source-sink pair, followed by a step-by-step explanation of the dataflow from source to sink. 
  This encourages the LLM to reason in multiple steps, explicitly tracing value flows and program logic, compared to mere answer output.
- **Example (Listing 1):**  
  ```
  User:
  Here is the program:
  1. int x = 0;
  2. x = 1 + x;
  3. int y = x;
  4. int z = 10 / y;
  Please detect the DBZ bugs in the program step by step.

  System:
  There is 1 divide-by-zero (DBZ) bug in the program:
  Bug 1: The value of x at the line 1 is assigned by the literal 0. It is used to assign zero value to the variable y at line 3. The value of y is used as the divisor at the line 4, such that the divisor is equal to 0. Hence, there is a DBZ bug at the line 4.
  ```

- **Applications:**  
  This approach is used for both end-to-end analysis and as a technique to synthesize source/sink extractors.

B. Decomposition via Tool Synthesis Prompts

- **Location/Explanation:**  
  See case studies and detailed results in Sections A.3.1 and A.3.2.
- **Description:**  
  Instead of prompting the LLM for a monolithic code analysis, LLMDFA decomposes tasks:
    - Synthesizing **source/sink extractors** using explicit prompt examples.
    - Synthesizing **path feasibility validation scripts**, e.g., Z3-based Python condition checkers.

  Prompts for extractor synthesis are based on user-specified examples and intended logic, pushing the LLM to synthesize deterministic extractors. Prompts for feasibility validation encode path conditions, using examples and constraints, challenging the LLM to reason about satisfiability.


C. Prompt Temperature and Sampling Strategies

- **Location/Explanation:**  
  See Section A.3.1.
- **Description:**  
  Temperature is set to 0 for all extraction-related prompting, making the LLM deterministic and greedy, avoiding spurious completions. This enforces consistency in extractor/script synthesis.

D. Direct End-to-End Prompting

- **Location/Explanation:**  
  Contrasted in section A.2.4, A.4.1 in hallucination/error analysis.
- **Description:**  
  Baseline approach: Prompting the LLM directly with the whole program and an open-ended question (“Find the bug”/“Trace the data flow…”), either zero- or few-shot, with or without CoT reasoning.
- **Observed Drawbacks:**  
  - Higher rates of hallucination, especially on larger or more complex code.
  - More frequent logical/semantic errors.
  - Less determinism in identifying true source-sink relationships.

RESULTS OF PROMPT STRATEGIES
----------------------------

1. Extractor Synthesis (Source/Sink)

   - **Metric: NFP (% successful with zero fixes), MNF (max #fixes), ANF (mean #fixes)**
   - **Table 6 Summary:**
     - For DBZ (Divide-by-zero):  
         Most LLMs achieved 95–100% NFP; Claude-3 achieved 100% NFP with zero fixes.
     - For XSS/OCSI:  
         Some LLMs required more fixes (e.g., Claude-3 for XSS sinks: 0% NFP, MNF up to 30, ANF 7.2).
     - **Conclusion:**  
         Decomposed extractor synthesis prompts are highly effective: >90% success with no fixes for most tasks; only outlier cases require more iterations.

2. Path Feasibility Validation Synthesis

   - **Metric:** Proportion of correct scripts in 0, 1, 2, 3+ fixes; correctness in encoding path conditions.
   - **Results (Figure 13a–d):**  
     - For gpt-3.5: 75–85% success with zero fixes; <5% failure after 3 rounds.
     - Similar performance for gpt-4, gemini-1.0, claude-3.
   - **Key Limitation:**  
     - Some complex conditions involving library or user functions were not always encoded correctly (e.g., misinterpreting Math.abs), but most errors still resulted in correct or "safe" infeasibility conclusions.

3. End-to-End Analysis vs. Decomposed Prompting

    - **Performance (Figures 14, 15):**
      - Precision, recall, F1 of LLMDFA (decomposed prompting with tool synthesis and CoT) consistently outperformed direct LLM end-to-end prompting and ablations (i.e., versions with NoSynExt, NoCoT, NoSynVal).
      - End-to-end LLM prompting suffered higher hallucination rates and logical errors, especially on longer/more complex inputs.
    - **Error Analysis:**
      - End-to-end LLMs sometimes hallucinate dataflow facts, misidentify sources/sinks, or make control-flow order errors.
      - LLMDFA avoids these via explicit, decomposed synthetic tools and step-by-step analysis via crafted prompts.

HALLUCINATION AND ERROR CASES
-----------------------------

- **Case I:** End-to-end LLM or NoSynExt identifies non-zero values (e.g., Integer.MIN_VALUE) as possible zero sources due to misunderstanding semantics.
- **Case II:** NoCoT (no chain-of-thought reasoning) or end-to-end LLMs misinterpret control/dataflow ordering.
- **Case III:** NoSynVal (direct prompting for feasibility) misclassifies path feasibility, giving rise to false positives.

All of these are mitigated by LLMDFA’s decomposed prompting and tool synthesis with example-based, few-shot CoT reasoning.

PROMPT STRATEGY – DESIGN SPECIFICS
-----------------------------------

- **Prompt Blocks:**  
   Each prompt for extractor or script synthesis includes:
     - A code snippet
     - Explicit request for extraction/summarization/conversion, usually step-by-step
     - Concrete examples or test cases for demonstration
     - For source/sink extraction: rules/examples of sources and sinks
     - For path feasibility: specific path conditions, constraints, and examples

- **Prompt Engineering:**  
   Designed for brevity and clarity, with explicit task separation to keep the context window short and reduce hallucinations.

- **Consistency Mechanism:**  
   Fixing iterations: The LLM is called repeatedly, with up to 20 retries per instance for extractor/script synthesis, adjusting the prompt or previous output until correctness is achieved (usually within 0–2 fixes for most tasks).

- **Temperature Setting:**  
   Always set to 0 to avoid LLM sampling randomness.

- **Chain-of-Thought Reasoning:**  
   Required in all step-by-step reasoning prompts to force explicit logical deduction.

CONCLUSION – EFFECTIVENESS OF LLMDFA PROMPTING
-----------------------------------------------
- **LLMDFA's prompting strategy, combining decomposition, tool synthesis, chain-of-thought, and temperature control, substantiates marked improvements in precision, recall, and F1 over naive end-to-end LLM prompting.**
- **Most extractor and feasibility scripts are synthesized in one step.** Failures are rare and usually relate to library or semantic complexity, not prompt design.
- **Explicit decomposition and prompting are key to reducing LLM hallucinations and logical errors in code analysis.**
- **Future work will focus on enhanced path condition encoding, perhaps with even more explicit prompting or symbolic strategies for library/user functions and global variables.**

Analysis of Prompting Strategies in LLMDFA for Data-Flow Analysis (TaintBench)

1. Context and Motivation
-------------------------
The analyzed content concerns the application of Large Language Models (LLMs) to data-flow analysis in Android apps, specifically using the LLMDFA framework over the TaintBench dataset. The goal is to trace data flows from "sources" (points where tainted/user-controlled input enters the system) to "sinks" (points where dangerous output may occur), e.g., leaking private data over the network.

A notable challenge is that LLMs, when prompted for summaries of function data-flows, can sometimes produce false positives—reporting spurious (incorrect) data-flow paths, as shown in the "false positive example" in Listing 9.

2. Prompting Strategies Used
----------------------------
The approaches explored by the researchers for using prompts with LLMs (such as GPT-3/4) revolve around extracting *dataflow summaries* at the function level, and then composing these to reason about inter-procedural data flows:

- **Function-level Prompting**: The LLM is shown a function's code and asked to summarize its data-flow behavior in a deterministic, structured format. For example, to identify the "start point" (where tainted data enters) and "end point" (where it could leak).
  - Prompts commonly ask: "Given the following function, list all variables where tainted input enters, and all locations where such data is used in a sink."

- **Speculative Path Reasoning**: The LLM is asked to infer whether a value obtained from a source (e.g., intent.getStringExtra("data")) could reach a sink (e.g., network output, outStream.write).
  - Composite prompts might show *partial code paths* or relay data-flow summaries from previously analyzed functions to support interprocedural reasoning.

- **Summary Chaining**: After obtaining LLM-inferred summaries for individual functions, the system composes them along the call-graph to build possible end-to-end data-flows (source → sink), using the structured outputs as glue.

- **Non-interactive (One-shot) and Interactive Prompting**: The researchers experiment with both one-shot inference (prompting with a single function at a time) and interactive, multi-step approaches (using answers from previous prompts as context in new ones).

3. Where the Strategies Are Discussed
-------------------------------------
The strategies are described in sections focused on the methodology for LLMDFA, likely within the "Methodology", "Implementation", or "Experimental Setup" parts of the paper. The excerpt provided contains references to false positives derived from these strategies, specifically in the context of analyzing long functions with complex control flows and indirect data passing.

4. Results of Prompting Strategies
----------------------------------
- **Effectiveness**:
  - LLMDFA was able to successfully find many real data-flows in TaintBench, showing promise that LLMs can infer semantic dataflows even in complex, obfuscated code.
  - The approach excels in scenarios where the mapping between sources and sinks is conceptually straightforward or intermediate data transformations are not overly complex.

- **Issues and Limitations**:
  - **Spurious Data-Flow Summaries**: As shown in Listing 9, function-level prompting sometimes led the LLM to declare non-existent dataflow paths (false positives). For example, it incorrectly associated the ‘url’ variable (populated from the “CHANGE_URL” command) with sinks expecting SMS data. This happened because the LLM treated all usages of 'intent.getStringExtra("data")' as equally tainted, regardless of actual control flow.
    - This kind of over-approximation arises because the LLM cannot precisely track context-sensitive data along control paths in long or multi-behavior functions.
  - **Compositional Weakness**: When chaining summaries, errors in function-level summaries accumulate or amplify, leading to more spurious full-path reports.
  - **Context Window Limitations**: In long functions or call chains, prompt truncation or limited context could mislead the LLM, hurting precision.

5. Success and Failure Modes
----------------------------
- **Successful Cases**:
  - Short functions with direct or clearly separated data-handling logic yielded high-quality, precise data-flow summaries from the LLM prompts.
  - When functions were well-documented or used descriptive variable names, the LLM could more reliably associate sources to sinks.
  - LLM was effective at extracting semantic meaning from idiomatic Android API usage.

- **Unsuccessful Cases**:
  - Functions implementing multiple behaviors (command dispatchers, large handlers) caused LLMs to over-approximate, conflating all possible data paths.
  - Lack of explicit path sensitivity (the LLM does not "execute" code) means that data is "smeared" across all control paths, resulting in spurious flows.
  - Errors in tokenization or code parsing under long context scenarios also led to prompt misinterpretation.

6. Specifics of Prompt Engineering
----------------------------------
- **Prompt Content**: Each prompt aimed to extract a) taint sources, b) taint sinks, c) intermediate flows ("summaries").
- **Prompt Format**: LLM answers were shaped into a structured summary: e.g., `variable X: start of taint`, `variable Y: end of taint`, etc.
- **Curated Examples**: Researchers sometimes provided exemplar function summaries as part of the prompt to "prime" the LLM to output in the desired format.
- **Post-processing**: Automated checking and composition of LLM outputs across functions, synthesizing overall flow paths.
- **Prompt Limitations Noted**: The strategy cannot, by design, track actual code execution traces — it depends on the LLM’s semantic analysis and language understanding, leading to over-approximations.

7. Conclusions
--------------
- Prompt engineering for LLMDFA leans on function-level analysis and structured summary outputs, with chaining to model interprocedural flows.
- The method is able to quickly surface both true and potential (but not necessarily real) dataflows, making it promising for rapid triage and analysis.
- However, precision is constrained by over-approximations, mainly when applied to complex, multi-purpose functions or poorly separated control paths.
- The technique complements—but cannot fully replace—more precise, path-sensitive, static data-flow analyses.
