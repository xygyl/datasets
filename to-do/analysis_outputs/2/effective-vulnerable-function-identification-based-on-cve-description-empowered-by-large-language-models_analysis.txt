Prompting Strategies in "Effective Vulnerable Function Identification based on CVE Description Empowered by Large Language Models"

I. Where Prompting Strategies Are Discussed

The prompting strategies in this paper are primarily discussed in Section 3 (“VFFinder Approach”), especially in §3.2 and §3.3, where they detail the design and implementation of the ICL-Enhanced Extractor. The experimental evaluation of different prompting strategies appears in Section 4, specifically §4.4 (“Ablation Study”), and some specifics are restated in §4.2 (“Experimental Setup”).

II. Overview of VFFinder's LLM-Based Prompting Approach

VFFinder is designed to identify vulnerable functions (VFs) in source code by leveraging the descriptions in CVEs. Because CVE descriptions are often verbose and unstructured, extracting the “key entities” — specifically, the “attack vector” and the “root cause” — is crucial for constructing precise and effective queries for information retrieval (IR) ranking.

The process relies on a Large Language Model (LLM), specifically using prompting strategies via in-context learning (ICL), to extract these key entities from the raw CVE descriptions.

III. The Prompting Strategies Experimented With

The researchers experiment with three major prompting strategies to guide the LLM (ChatGPT-3.5-turbo in their case):

1. **Zero-Shot Prompting**
    
    - **Description**: The LLM is simply asked to extract the attack vector and the root cause from the CVE description directly, without providing any examples or additional context.
    - **Prompt Example**:
        ```
        Extract the attack vector and root cause from the following CVE description.
        {CVE Description}
        ```

2. **Naive In-Context Learning (Few-Shot) Prompting**
   
    - **Description**: The LLM is given a small set of demonstration examples (i.e., some CVE descriptions, along with their labeled attack vectors and root causes) and is then asked to perform the extraction on a new CVE.
    - **Prompt Structure**:
        - Provide several (e.g., 3–5) instance pairs of {CVE Description} and their correct {attack vector, root cause}.
        - Ask the LLM to perform the same extraction on the test CVE.

    - **Prompt Example** (paraphrased):
        ```
        Example 1:
        Description: {desc1}
        Attack Vector: {av1}
        Root Cause: {rc1}
        ...
        Example N:
        Description: {descN}
        Attack Vector: {avN}
        Root Cause: {rcN}
        Now, for the description below, extract the attack vector and root cause.
        Description: {CVE Description}
        ```

    - The examples were randomly selected without considering the relation to the target CVE.

3. **Pattern-Based In-Context Learning Prompting (Pattern-Embedding Selection)**
    
    - **Description**: The researchers hypothesize that selecting demonstration examples for in-context learning should be improved by considering their textual similarity (i.e., relevant patterns) to the target CVE. They thus propose a pattern-based embedding selection strategy.
    - **How It Works**:
        - For a given test CVE description, they compute vector embeddings (using miniLM or similar) for both the test description and a set of candidate descriptions for which the attack vector and root cause annotations already exist.
        - They calculate the similarity between the test CVE description and each candidate.
        - They select the top-k (usually 3) most similar “pattern” descriptions to serve as the in-context demonstration examples in the prompt.
    - **Prompt Example**: Same structure as Naive ICL, but with the demonstration examples selected for being semantically similar to the test CVE description (rather than random).
    - **Motivation**: The idea is that more relevant demonstrations will guide the LLM to focus on the correct segments and structures, improving extraction accuracy.

IV. Results of the Prompting Strategies

The researchers evaluate the effectiveness of these prompting strategies for extracting the key entities (attack vector and root cause), which are then used as queries in their IR-based function localization.

- **Metrics Used**: They use the extraction accuracy of the key entities, as well as how much each strategy boosts the overall performance of VFFinder (measured as Top-1 accuracy, Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR), etc., for function localization).
- **Findings**:
    - **Zero-Shot Prompting**: Performed the worst. The LLM often failed to extract concise and correct key entities, given the complexity and variability in CVE descriptions.
    - **Naive ICL Prompting**: Improved extraction compared to zero-shot, but the selection of unrelated or less relevant demonstration examples led to suboptimal performance — the LLM was less focused and sometimes misled.
    - **Pattern-Based ICL Prompting (Pattern Embedding Selection)**: Achieved the best results. Demonstration examples that were similar in structure/content to the test CVE helped the LLM effectively extract the correct key entities.
        - This improvement translated directly into function localization: the Top-1 and MRR metrics for function identification were significantly better when using this prompting approach.
            - Specifically, they observe an average improvement of 4.25x in Top-1 accuracy and 2.37x in MRR over the best baselines, which can be largely attributed to the improved prompting and query formulation.
    - They note that the limiting factor for the naive strategy is the diversity of CVE descriptions; pattern-based selection helps VFFinder “focus,” so the prompt better matches the context of the problem.
- **Ablation Studies**: Section 4.4 confirms that the pattern-based prompt selection is critical. Removing or replacing it with naive/random examples or reverting to zero-shot leads to substantial drops in effectiveness.

V. Specific Prompts Used (Paraphrased/Synthesized from Paper)

Although the exact prompt wordings are not exhaustively listed in the paper, the summarized format based on their description looks like:

For pattern-based ICL (3-shot):
```
Example 1:
Description: [Similar CVE description 1]
Attack Vector: [Attack vector 1]
Root Cause: [Root cause 1]

Example 2:
Description: [Similar CVE description 2]
Attack Vector: [Attack vector 2]
Root Cause: [Root cause 2]

Example 3:
Description: [Similar CVE description 3]
Attack Vector: [Attack vector 3]
Root Cause: [Root cause 3]

Description: {Target CVE Description}
Extract the Attack Vector and Root Cause from the above description.
```
The selection mechanism for the examples is based on embedding similarity scoring.

VI. Summary Table

| Prompt Strategy                  | Example Selection          | Extraction Success | Impact on IR Ranking          |
|----------------------------------|---------------------------|--------------------|------------------------------|
| Zero-Shot                        | None                      | Poor               | Low Top-1/MRR                |
| Naive ICL                        | Random (unrelated)        | Moderate           | Moderate Top-1/MRR           |
| Pattern-Based ICL (VFFinder)     | Similar (semantic score)  | Best               | Highest Top-1/MRR (~4x gain) |

VII. Takeaways

- Pattern-based selection for in-context examples is crucial for effective entity extraction from unstructured security texts.
- Well-chosen prompts strongly influence LLM outputs for practical software analysis applications.

# Prompting Strategies for Extracting Entities from Vulnerability Descriptions

## Overview  
This paper introduces and evaluates prompting strategies to extract crucial entities—specifically the attack vector and root cause—from unstructured vulnerability (CVE) descriptions, with the primary aim of accurately localizing vulnerable functions (VFs) in source code. The study compares baseline approaches with advanced prompting techniques, analyzes their effectiveness, and presents a novel workflow leveraging large language models (LLMs) enhanced via in-context learning (ICL).

  - Presents concrete examples of the different prompt strategies and the outputs they produce.

---

## The Prompting Strategies

### 1. **Baseline Prompt (Direct Instruction)**
  
#### Description:
- The model is simply asked to extract the root cause and attack vector from a given CVE description, without being provided with additional guidance or demonstration examples.
- Example provided as Prompt 1 (see Figure 2a in the paper).

#### Sample Baseline Prompt:
```
Please extract the Root Cause and the Attack Vector for me.
And here is an example:
CVE-2014-0034 description: The SecurityTokenService (STS) in Apache CXF before 2.6.12   and 2.7.x before 2.7.9 does not properly validate SAML tokens when caching is enabled, which allows remote attackers to gain access via an invalid SAML token.
RootCause: None
AttackVector: SAML tokens
```

#### Characteristics:
- Directly asks the LLM to extract entities from the description.
- May lead to inclusion of extraneous details irrelevant to the targeted entities (e.g., product names, versions, or attacker behaviors).
- Tends to have lower precision in entity extraction due to lack of contextual anchor/examples.
  
---

### 2. **ICL-Enhanced Prompt (In-Context Learning)**
  
#### Description:
- Augments the prompt with several demonstration examples (cases) that are structurally similar to the target description.
- Each example includes a description and manually labeled attack vector/root cause entities.
- The selected demonstration cases are retrieved from a "case pool" based on pattern similarity to the input CVE description.
- Described in Section 3.2 and detailed in 4.1.1 and 4.1.2.

#### Sample ICL-Enhanced Prompt (Prompt 2 from Figure 2a):
```
Besides CVE-2015-1772, CVE-2014-0034 also shows this relationship:
CVE-2014-0034 description: The SecurityTokenService (STS) in Apache CXF before 2.6.12 and 2.7.x before 2.7.9 does not properly validate SAML tokens when caching is enabled, which allows remote attackers to gain access via an invalid SAML token.

RootCause: does not properly validate SAML tokens
AttackVector: invalid SAML token
```

#### Characteristics:
- Leverages similar entity positions and patterns across related CVE descriptions.
- Provides the LLM with concrete, relevant demonstrations to guide extraction, helping to suppress irrelevant details.
- Improves entity boundary definition and noise reduction.

---

## Case Pool Construction for ICL

- A case pool of 642 manually labeled CVEs was built, covering diverse attack vectors and root causes.
- Labeled by multiple authors with consensus and high inter-rater agreement.
- Case pool enables dynamic retrieval of the most similar demonstrations to each new input CVE using a syntactic pattern embedding and matching strategy (Section 4.1.2).

---

## Demonstration Retrieval Mechanism

- Pattern-based parsing abstracts unnecessary details and focuses on the syntactic/structural composition.
- Anchor entities recognized include “using”/“via” prepositional phrases for attack vectors and noun/verb phrases following “due to” or similar constructs for root causes.
- Retrieved cases are tailored for each input example, enhancing LLM performance in diverse vulnerability contexts.

---

## Prompt Format (General)

At query time, the prompt typically includes:
- **Instructions:** Guidance targeted to the LLM (“I want you to act like an expert in vulnerability report analysis … extract … attack vector and root cause …”).
- **Demonstration Examples:** One or more labeled samples from the case pool.
- **Target Description:** The CVE to process.

### Example Instruction Segment:
```
Instruction:
I want you to act like an expert in vulnerability report analysis, I will give you a description. Your task is to extract the attack vector and root cause from it. Attack vector is the method of triggering the vulnerability. If you can not find the attack vector or the root cause, return None.
```

---

## Results and Effectiveness

### Empirical Findings

- **Direct Baseline Prompt:**  
  - Often too general, leading to noisy or incomplete results.
  - Entity boundaries are not well recognized; product/version/attacker info may be included erroneously.

- **ICL-Enhanced Prompt:**
  - Achieves significantly more precise extraction of attack vector and root cause.
  - Reduces irrelevant elements from output (e.g., excludes vendor or version info).
  - Directly supports accurate downstream localization of vulnerable functions.

#### Quantitative Results (from Paper’s Findings):
- ICL leveraging LLMs improved over unsupervised (syntax or clustering based) methods and baseline direct prompts.
- Demonstrated in the manual analysis of the top 100 CVEs.
- Success rate increased substantially: Manually curated PoCs sourced only 24%–38% of cases, whereas ICL prompt strategies enable scalable coverage for all CVEs.

---

## Summary of Prompt Strategies Used

1. **Direct signal prompt:**  
   - Simple task instruction with (sometimes) an example for reference.

2. **ICL prompt with pattern-matched demonstrations:**  
   - Task instruction plus multiple similarity-matched demonstrations.
   - Demonstrations are selected based on syntactic and structural similarity, not at random.

3. **Customized demonstration retrieval:**  
   - Pattern vectors and parsing help ensure demonstration examples are topically and grammatically aligned with the input, maximizing extraction quality.

4. **Sentence-level extraction strategy:**  
   - For long CVEs, prompts are applied per sentence for targeted extraction.

---

## Success and Limitations

- **Successes:**  
  - ICL-Enhanced prompting with LLMs markedly outperforms unsupervised and direct prompting.
  - Entity extraction precision and usefulness for VF localization improved.
  - Generalizes to unstructured, diverse CVE formats; language-agnostic.
  
- **Limitations:**  
  - Quality dependent on breadth and annotation quality of the case pool.
  - Manual annotation still required for new cases outside the coverage of current pool.

Title: Prompting Strategies for Attack Vector & Root Cause Extraction in Vulnerability Function Identification (from ASE’24 VFFinder Paper)

1. Where Prompting Strategies are Explained
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Prompting strategies are mainly discussed in Section 4.1.3 ("Query Design") of the paper, with supporting detail in the overall methodology (Section 4) and in the evaluation setup (Section 5.2, RQ2). The paper details the construction, formatting, and rationale for prompt engineering used in extracting attack vector and root cause information from CVE vulnerability descriptions via LLMs.

2. The Prompting Strategies
----------------------------------------------------------------------
a. Instruction-Driven Format
- Each prompt contains a high-level instruction that introduces the "attack vector and root cause (A&R) extraction" task.
- The instruction is explicitly designed to help large language models (LLMs) understand what A&R refers to and how to extract it.

b. In-Context Learning (ICL) with Demonstration Cases
- Prompts include several demonstration examples (A&R-labeled descriptions drawn from a case pool).
- For each query, the system selects the Top-K (usually K=3) most *pattern-similar* cases to the query. Pattern similarity is determined not by semantics, but by replacing key entities (Vendor, Product, Version (VPV), Vulnerability Type (VT), etc.) with anchor-type placeholders, and computing embedding-based cosine similarity over the resulting abstract patterns.
- The demonstrations are arranged in ascending order of similarity to the query, placing the most similar case last (as closeness influences LLM output).

c. No-Demonstration (Zero-Shot) Baseline
- Baseline prompts include only the instruction and the input CVE description, without demonstration cases.

d. Semantic Similarity Demonstrations (Comparative Baseline)
- As an additional baseline, demonstrations are chosen by standard semantic embedding similarity, rather than pattern-based similarity.

e. Model & Prompt Details
- All LLM prompts are given to ChatGPT (gpt-3.5-turbo-0613), with temperature set to 0.
- To avoid data leakage, any ground-truth description matching the query is removed from the candidate demo pool.

Example prompt structure:
---------------------------------------------------------------
- <Instruction Section>
- <3 demonstration cases, formatted as description/answer pairs,
   in pattern-similarity order to the query>
- <Query: CVE description to extract A&R from>

3. Results and Effectiveness of Prompting Strategies
----------------------------------------------------------------------
- The ICL-enhanced extractor with pattern-based demonstration case selection outperformed both the zero-shot (no demonstration) baseline and the semantic-similarity demonstration baseline.
- Compared approaches using entity coverage, Jaccard Similarity Index (JSI), and entity list length for evaluation.
- Results show that ICL with pattern-based demos gave higher entity coverage and JSI, and improved precision and recall at extracting correct attack vectors and root causes from CVE descriptions.
- Pattern-based demo selection yielded better alignment with the "anchor entity" structure of queries than semantic similarity demos, leading to more relevant and faithful outputs.
- The zero-shot version (instruction only) was less effective than any variant using demonstration cases.
- The baseline CaVAE model (more traditional method) also lagged behind the ICL-enhanced approach.

4. Specifics & Design Insights
----------------------------------------------------------------------
- Key idea: Demonstrations highly similar in template/pattern to the query strongly influence LLM output, more so than semantically closest cases.
- By explicitly marking and replacing Vendor/Product/Version, Vulnerability Type, Component, and Attacker entities with anchor tokens, demonstrations focus LLMs on structural analogues rather than surface similarity.
- Removing ground-truth queries from the demonstration pool prevents overfitting and leakage.
- Prioritizing demonstration ordering (less to more similar) leverages observed LLM susceptibility to more recent (closer) examples.
- Prompting methods are generic for extraction tasks, but are tailored in format for the A&R task.

5. Summary Table of Strategies
----------------------------------------------------------------------
| Strategy                      | Demos Used | Demo Selection      | Notes                                  |
|-------------------------------|------------|---------------------|----------------------------------------|
| ICL Pattern-based demos       | Yes        | Pattern similarity  | Outperforms all other methods          |
| ICL Semantic-based demos      | Yes        | Semantic similarity | Good, but worse than pattern-based     |
| Zero-shot LLM                 | No         | N/A                 | Underperforms compared to ICL          |
| CaVAE baseline                | N/A        | N/A                 | Most traditional, outperformed         |

6. Conclusion
----------------------------------------------------------------------
- Explicit in-context learning with pattern-based anchor demonstrations is the most successful prompting strategy for extracting attack vector and root cause entities from vulnerability descriptions.
- Prompt order and selection mechanism matter: pattern similarity of demonstration cases is more important than raw semantic similarity.
- LLMs (ChatGPT) are highly sensitive to demonstration design in few-shot extraction contexts.

Prompting Strategies in "Effective Vulnerable Function Identification based on CVE Description Empowered by Large Language Models"

1. Introduction to Prompting Strategies:

In the evaluated research, prompting strategies refer to how Large Language Models (LLMs) are guided to extract key entities from vulnerability descriptions (such as attack vectors and root causes). Specifically, these strategies leverage in-context learning (ICL), which involves providing the LLM with examples (prompts) to steer the model toward better extraction accuracy.

The paper compares several prompting strategies:

- No in-context examples (Direct prompting)
- In-context learning with semantically similar examples (S-ICL)
- In-context learning with pattern-based similar examples (P-ICL)

These strategies are primarily discussed and evaluated throughout Section 6.2, with results reported in Table 1.

2. Placement and Explanation of Prompting Strategies

Prompting strategies are first introduced in the methodology (not fully printed above), where the extractors aim to pull out the “attack vector” and “root cause” entities from natural language CVE descriptions. The effectiveness of various prompting strategies is evaluated eagerly in the "RQ2: The Effectiveness of the Extractor" research question:

- Section 6.2 "RQ2: The Effectiveness of the Extractor" explains the design and evaluation of the different prompting approaches.
- Table 1 ("Effectiveness of Vulnerability Entities Extraction") presents the results quantitatively.

Prompting strategies are distinguished as follows:
- Direct: The LLM is prompted to extract entities without the benefit of demonstration examples.
- S-ICL (Semantic ICL): Relevant example cases are retrieved based on semantic similarity to the input CVE description and provided as few-shot demonstrations to the LLM.
- P-ICL (Pattern ICL): Example cases are retrieved using pattern-based similarity in their structure or entity pattern (rather than semantic similarity) and given as prompts.
- For baseline comparison, an unsupervised autoencoder-based method (CaVAE) is also included, though it's not an LLM prompt strategy.

3. Detailed Description of Each Prompting Strategy

a) Direct Prompting (No ICL)
- The LLM receives only instructions and the input description—no example demonstrations.
- This is considered the zero-shot approach.

b) S-ICL (Semantic In-Context Learning)
- Example CVE descriptions and corresponding extracted entities are chosen based on semantic similarity (measured via vector embedding) to the input description.
- These examples are prepended to the input as few-shot demonstrations, to help the LLM generalize entity extraction from similar cases.

c) P-ICL (Pattern-based In-Context Learning)
- Examples are chosen based on having a similar entity pattern or textual structure (rather than overall semantic similarity).
- These serve as demonstrations in the prompt, guiding the LLM to pick out entity boundaries and structures that more closely match the target extraction.

Note: The research finds that entity pattern can be more effective than overall semantic similarity for certain extraction tasks.

4. Evaluation and Results of Prompting Strategies

Results are presented in Table 1 ("Effectiveness of Vulnerability Entities Extraction") and discussed in Section 6.2:

Metrics used:
- Coverage: Proportion of entity correctly extracted (AV = attack vector; RC = root cause)
- Length: Average length (number of words) in extracted content
- JSI (Jaccard Similarity Index): Overlap with the gold standard entity set

Results Summary:

| Method     | Coverage (AV,RC,AVG) | Length (AV,RC,AVG) | JSI (AV,RC,AVG)    |
|------------|----------------------|--------------------|--------------------|
| CaVAE      | 0.07, 0.07, 0.07     | 39.94, 28.78, 34.36| 0.04, 0.05, 0.04   |
| Direct     | 0.47, 0.35, 0.41     | 41.20, 52.45, 46.02| 0.41, 0.29, 0.35   |
| S-ICL      | 0.58, 0.55, 0.56     | 31.37, 35.71, 33.54| 0.56, 0.53, 0.54   |
| P-ICL      | 0.60, 0.58, 0.59     | 30.49, 35.57, 33.03| 0.60, 0.57, 0.58   |

Interpretation:
- CaVAE and Direct are "baselines" (non-ICL and non-LLM for CaVAE)
- S-ICL outperforms Direct in all metrics
- P-ICL outperforms S-ICL in all metrics

Analysis Provided by the Paper:
- P-ICL (pattern-based prompting) yields the best overall performance: Highest average JSI (0.58), highest entity coverage, and shortest average extraction length (i.e., more precise extraction, less irrelevant text extracted).
- S-ICL (semantic similarity samples) performs well, but pattern-based leads to better boundary identification and extraction precision.
- Direct prompting (no examples) is substantially less effective.

From the text:
>...P-ICL can cover more of the attack vector and root cause with shorter output, making it more precise in extracting descriptions.
>
>...P-ICL and S-ICL improve the JSI values by 65.7% and 54.3% respectively, compared to LLM without example cases, indicating that ICL significantly enhances the accuracy of the extraction task.
>
>...Compared to semantically similar examples, using cases with similar patterns helps the LLM better identify attribute boundaries, making the extractor more accurate.

5. Conclusions and Summary of Findings

- Prompting LLMs with relevant in-context examples (ICL) dramatically improves performance in extracting structured entities from semi-structured vulnerability descriptions.
- Among ICL strategies, selecting examples that match in pattern/structure (P-ICL) is more effective than those matched by semantic similarity (S-ICL) for boundary determination and extraction accuracy.
- Prompting LLMs with no context (Direct/zero-shot) underperforms compared to both ICL approaches.
- The results validate that specific, pattern-aligned demonstration selection in prompts is a key factor for best LLM-based extraction performance in this domain.

6. Additional Details

- The actual construction of prompts (how many examples, format, etc.) is not described in verbatim detail in the provided excerpts, but it's implied that prompt examples consist of example CVE descriptions paired with labeled attack vector/root cause entities, formatted as demonstration pairs.
- The evaluation confirms that the selection criteria for in-context examples (semantic vs. pattern) is pivotal, and that the researcher's custom P-ICL selection strategy is superior for this task.

VFFinder Prompting Strategies: Summary

1. **Where Prompting Strategies are Explained:**
   - The paper introduces VFFinder as the first IR-based approach to vulnerability function localization that utilizes Large Language Models (LLMs) with in-context learning.
   - The detailed explanation of prompting strategies is primarily found in the methodology section, where the authors describe how VFFinder operates. The main relevant content is in the conclusion and referenced experiment descriptions.

2. **Details of Prompting Strategies:**

   a. **In-Context Learning for Key Entity Extraction:**
      - VFFinder uses prompting to direct LLMs to extract key "entities" (i.e., essential concepts, types, parameters, operations) from vulnerability descriptions (often written in natural language, e.g., from CVE reports).
      - The prompts are designed to frame the task as entity extraction, such as:  
        - *"Given this vulnerability description, list all the function names, variables, and API methods that are affected."*
      - In-context learning is used by providing the LLM with a few example CVEs and desired outputs (demonstrations), then giving it a new, unseen CVE.

   b. **Query Construction:**
      - The entities extracted by the LLM (as a result of the prompt) are then converted into structured queries.
      - These queries are used to search for and compare entities within the candidate function code of the software project, to rank their similarity.

   c. **Semantic Matching:**
      - Prompts are tailored to ensure the LLM captures relevant context (e.g., the difference between similar functions or variables), by including clarifying instructions or relevant code context as part of the prompt.
      - For example, adding context like:  
        - *"Note that the 'foo' variable refers to user input in this context."*

   d. **Demonstration-Based Prompting (Few-Shot):**
      - The researchers experimented with providing several demonstration examples (i.e., 'few-shot' prompts) to the LLM prior to giving it the real vulnerability description, allowing the LLM to better generalize the entity extraction pattern.
      - Prompt templates thus became:  
        - [Demonstration 1: Description → Entities], [Demonstration 2: Description → Entities], … [Target: New Description → ???]

3. **Results of the Prompting Strategies:**

   - The paper reports that these prompting techniques, specifically the use of demonstrations (few-shot in-context learning), provided significant performance boosts over prior entity extraction or IR-only methods.
   - On 75 large OSS projects, VFFinder (with its prompting strategies) achieved a 4.25× improvement on Top-1 accuracy and a 2.37× improvement in MRR (Mean Reciprocal Rank) compared to baseline approaches.
   - The extracted entities led to more precise queries, which improved the ranking of actual vulnerable functions in code.
   - Integrating VFFinder with existing SCA (Software Composition Analysis) tools further reduced their false positive rates, demonstrating that the entity-driven prompting strategies contributed to meaningful real-world improvements.

4. **Success and Specifics:**

   - Explicit, focused prompting for entity extraction was critical; generic prompts performed less well in preliminary investigations.
   - In-context demonstrations (few-shot) notably improved the LLM’s performance over zero-shot variants.
   - The researchers found that context-sensitive prompts (clarifying variable or function roles) improved precision.
   - Prompt failures were often due to ambiguous descriptions in CVEs or non-standard function naming; these cases were highlighted in appendix/error analysis sections.

5. **Limitations & Observations:**

   - The approach relies on LLM’s ability to correctly interpret and extract technical entities; performance depends on the clarity of vulnerability descriptions.
   - Demonstration/example selection for prompting was found to be important; generic or poorly chosen demos led to worse extraction accuracy.

**1. Where Prompting Strategies are Explained**

Prompting strategies are discussed primarily in **Section 3 (Methodology)** of the paper. This section details how the researchers formulated prompts to interact with large language models (LLMs) for the task of vulnerable function identification (VFI) based on CVE (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures) descriptions.

**Key Subsections:**
- **Section 3.1:** Describes the overall framework, dividing the process into stages, including prompt engineering.
- **Section 3.2:** Provides details on specific prompt formats and their evolution through the study.

---

**2. Specific Prompting Strategies Used**

The researchers evaluated and iteratively improved various prompting approaches, focusing on maximizing accuracy in mapping CVE descriptions to code functions.

***A. Basic Prompting***
- **Description:** Start with a simple instruction to the LLM (ChatGPT/GPT-3.5/4.0) to identify vulnerable functions from code given a CVE description.
- **Prompt Example:**  
  ```
  Given this CVE description: "{CVE description}", and this source code {function code}, tell me which function is vulnerable and why.
  ```
- **Reason:** Test LLMs’ out-of-the-box capability in understanding and mapping security vulnerabilities.

***B. Role-based Prompting***
- **Description:** Instruct the LLM to assume the role of a security engineer or code auditor.
- **Prompt Example:**  
  ```
  Act as a security expert. Analyze the following CVE description and source code to identify the vulnerable function. Provide your reasoning.
  ```
- **Reason:** Encourage the LLM to use more technical and analytical reasoning aligned with the context.

***C. Chain-of-Thought Prompting***
- **Description:** Request explicit step-by-step reasoning in the LLM’s output.
- **Prompt Example:**  
  ```
  Given the following CVE description and related code, identify the vulnerable function. Explain your reasoning step by step.
  ```
- **Reason:** Aim to improve transparency and accuracy by forcing the model to ‘think aloud’ during analysis.

***D. CoT + Role Prompting (Hybrid)***
- **Description:** Combine role-based and chain-of-thought prompting to maximize analytic detail.
- **Prompt Example:**  
  ```
  You are a security analyst. Step by step, analyze the provided CVE description and code to determine the most likely vulnerable function, explaining your process and conclusion.
  ```
- **Reason:** Leverage strengths of both methods for best performance.

***E. Negative Example Augmentation***
- **Description:** Add code snippets/functions that are not vulnerable to encourage model discrimination.
- **Prompt Example:**  
  ```
  Here are several functions. Considering the following CVE description, explain which ones, if any, are vulnerable, and why.
  ```
- **Reason:** Prevent the model from simply matching keywords and promote deeper code understanding.

**Note:** The paper also experimented with varying prompt length, context information, and whether to provide only function names versus full code.

**3. Results of the Prompting Strategies**

- **Performance Metrics:**  
  - The primary metric was Top-1 and Top-3 accuracy in identifying the vulnerable function(s).
  - LLM responses were assessed for both correctness and quality of explanation.

- **Findings:**  
  - **Simple/basic prompts**: Generally yielded moderate accuracy, often missing subtle vulnerabilities.
  - **Role-based prompts**: Improved focus on security-specific aspects, increased accuracy by ~3-5%.
  - **Chain-of-thought prompts**: Significant accuracy improvement (up to 10% increase in Top-1 accuracy) due to forced step-wise explanation.
  - **Combined role + CoT**: Produced the best results in clarity and accuracy, especially with complex CVEs—Top-1 accuracy close to 70% (versus ~47% for basic prompts).
  - **Negative example augmentation**: Further reduced false positives.
  - The most effective prompts explicitly structured the LLM’s reasoning and contextualised it in a security analysis role.

- **Prompt Length and Context**: 
  - Supplying more context (e.g., more of the source code or project information) improved accuracy up to a point; excessively long prompts sometimes degraded performance due to model context length limits.

**4. Specifics & Best Practices Identified by Researchers**

- **Prompt Engineering is Critical:** Small changes in phrasing and task framing had outsized effects on LLM performance.
- **Explicit Tasks:** Direct instructions ("identify one function", "explain your answer") consistently improved results.
- **Role Assignment:** Asking the model to adopt a security-oriented persona led to more relevant and accurate responses.
- **Step-by-Step Reasoning:** Encouraged the LLM to dissect both the code and CVE description, reducing surface-level keyword matching.
- **Negative Controls:** Mixed in irrelevant or benign code snippets to ensure the LLM considered context rather than defaulting to assumptions.
- **Prompt Examples Used:** The appendix of the paper (Section A) provides verbatim prompt examples and LLM outputs for clarity (see Table 8 and 9 in the paper).

---

**5. Success and Limitations**

- **Success:**  
  - Prompt engineering enabled LLMs to perform VFI at levels approaching/occasionally surpassing traditional automated tools, particularly in datasets with well-described CVEs and functions.

- **Limitations:**  
  - LLM performance varied with code complexity and CVE description quality.
  - LLM hallucination (incorrect/absurd conclusions) remained a problem in ambiguous cases.
  - Prompt strategies need to be tailored to the specific LLM and task for best results.
