# Prompting Strategies in "Large Language Models are Zero-Shot Reasoners" (Kojima et al., 2022)

## 1. Overview of Prompting Strategies

This paper discusses and compares four main prompting strategies for eliciting reasoning in large language models (LLMs):

1. **Standard Few-shot Prompting**
2. **Few-shot Chain-of-Thought (Few-shot-CoT) Prompting**
3. **Standard Zero-shot Prompting**
4. **Zero-shot Chain-of-Thought (Zero-shot-CoT) Prompting (proposed method)**

---

## 3. Detailed Prompting Strategies

### 3.1 Standard Few-shot Prompting

- **Description:** Present a model with several input-output examples corresponding to the task, then ask the model to answer a new question in the same format.
- **Example (Fig. 1a):**
  - **Q:** Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans... Each can has 3... How many in total?
  - **A:** The answer is 11.
  - (Followed by a question for the model to answer in the same format.)

- **Characteristics:** 
  - Task-specific examples
  - Usually no explicit requirement for stepwise reasoning

### 3.2 Few-shot Chain-of-Thought Prompting (Few-shot-CoT)

- **Description:** Similar to Standard Few-shot, but answer examples *explicitly demonstrate step-by-step reasoning* for each example before giving a final answer.
- **Example (Fig. 1b):**
  - **Q:** Roger has 5 tennis balls...
  - **A:** Roger started with 5 balls. 2 cans x 3 balls = 6 tennis balls. 5 + 6 = 11. The answer is 11.

- **Characteristics:** 
  - Task-specific, hand-crafted examples
  - Each includes *multi-step reasoning* before the answer
  - Known to boost multi-step reasoning tasks
  - Requires human engineering for every task and careful answer-format alignment

### 3.3 Standard Zero-shot Prompting

- **Description:** Present the question with an instruction or template (e.g., "The answer (arabic numerals) is ...") but *no exemplars*.
- **Example (Fig. 1c):**
  - **Q:** A juggler can juggle 16 balls. Half... How many blue balls?
  - **A:** The answer (arabic numerals) is 
  - → Model outputs: "8" (incorrect; fails to decompose problem)

- **Characteristics:**
  - No samples/demonstrations
  - Depends on the instruction
  - Typically weak for multi-step problems

### 3.4 Zero-shot Chain-of-Thought Prompting (Zero-shot-CoT, Ours)

- **Description:** *Single-task-agnostic, template-based prompting* where a generic phrase, e.g., "Let's think step by step," is inserted before the answer request for every question. No hand-crafted examples required.
- **Example (Fig. 1d):**
  - **Q:** A juggler can juggle 16 balls. Half... How many blue balls?
  - **A:** Let's think step by step.
    - LLM then outputs:
      - There are 16 balls. Half are golf: 8. Half of 8 are blue: 4 blue. (Correct)

- **Characteristics:**
  - No exemplars/examples—works with just the generic prompt
  - Versatile across different reasoning, logic, arithmetic tasks
  - Relies only on task-agnostic "trigger" to elicit stepwise reasoning
  - The researchers tested variations ("Let's work this out step by step", etc.)

#### 3.4.1 Two-stage Prompting for Zero-shot-CoT

Described in §3.1 and Figure 2.

**Step 1: Reasoning Extraction**
- Input prompt: "Q: [QUESTION] A: Let's think step by step."
- LLM produces full reasoning trace.

**Step 2: Answer Extraction**
- Concatenate:
  - The original question and "Let's think step by step."
  - The LLM's reasoning output from step 1.
  - An answer extraction trigger (e.g., "Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is")
- Feed combined prompt to LLM, parse the answer from the generated text.

**Answer Extraction Triggers:** Adjusted depending on nature of task (see Appendix A.5):
- Numeric: "Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is"
- Multi-choice: "Therefore, among A through E, the answer is"
- Others as necessary

## 4. Results of Prompting Strategies

### Successes and Comparisons (Section 4, Table 2 in paper)

- **Zero-shot-CoT vs. Standard Zero-shot:**  
  - Dramatic improvement—e.g., MultiArith (arithmetic): from 17.7% (Zero-shot) to 78.7% (Zero-shot-CoT) with InstructGPT (text-davinci-002).
  - GSM8K (grade school math): from 10.4% (Zero-shot) to 40.7% (Zero-shot-CoT).
  - Similar boost in performance with PaLM 540B model (another LLM).

- **Zero-shot-CoT vs. Few-shot-CoT:**  
  - Zero-shot-CoT is still *outperformed* by Few-shot-CoT, which uses carefully engineered multi-step reasoning exemplars per task.
  - But, Zero-shot-CoT closes much of the gap, *despite not requiring any task-specific demonstration*.

- **Zero-shot-CoT vs. Few-shot Standard:**  
  - Often outperforms even few-shot baselines that lack chain-of-thought reasoning.

### Notable Notes:

- **Robustness:** Unlike Few-shot-CoT, Zero-shot-CoT is *task-agnostic*; the same generic prompt works across tasks.
- **Prompt Sensitivity:** Few-shot-CoT is sensitive—if the demonstrations do not match the test question type, performance drops.
- **Scaling:** Zero-shot-CoT enables LLMs to follow improved scaling behavior (larger models = better performance) similar to Few-shot-CoT, but with less prompt engineering.

---

## 5. Specifics of Researcher Prompts

### Trigger Sentences for Zero-shot-CoT (see Table 4, Appendix)

- "Let's think step by step."
- "Let's work this out step by step."
- Other variants are possible; "Let's think step by step." found to work well.

### Answer Triggers (Appendix A.5)

- Numeric answer: "Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is"
- Multiple choice: "Therefore, among A through E, the answer is"
- Adjusted as needed for expected answer type per task

### Prompt Templates

- **Reasoning Extraction:**
  - Q: [Question]
  - A: Let's think step by step.

- **Answer Extraction:**
  - [Q: ... A: Let's think step by step.] [Reasoning Output] [Answer extraction trigger]

### Decoding:

- All generations used greedy decoding for LLM output, for simplicity and reproducibility.

### Formatting:

- For zero-shot baseline, usually prompt like "The answer (arabic numerals) is"
- For Few-shot-CoT, each few-shot example must end with the answer in the correct format.
- For Zero-shot-CoT, two prompts are used to (a) produce reasoning, and (b) to extract/parsing the answer.

---

3. **Detailed Prompting Methods & Specifics**

**A. Zero-shot Prompting**

- *What it is*: Presenting just the question/problem without demonstrations or reasoning steps.
- *Example*: 
    > "What is 23 + 54?"

- *Answer extraction*: The first valid answer in the output is selected, by either a format-specific prompt or the standard "The answer is" prompt.

**B. Zero-shot Chain of Thought (Zero-shot-CoT) Prompting**

- *What it is*: Eliciting multi-step reasoning by appending a cue to the prompt encouraging step-by-step reasoning, with **no demonstration examples** provided.

- *Canonical template*: 
    > "Let’s think step by step."

- *Prompting format example*:
    > Q: If you have 3 apples and buy 2 more, how many apples do you have?
    > A: Let's think step by step.

- The model generates intermediate reasoning steps before giving the answer.

- *Answer extraction*: The first valid answer after the reasoning is extracted for evaluation.

- *Variants*: Other reason-inviting templates were tested (see Table 4), e.g., "First," "Let’s think about this logically," etc.

**C. Few-shot Prompting**

- *What it is*: Providing a fixed number of in-context examples (e.g., 2, 4, 8) with correct outputs, but no explicit reasoning steps.

- *Example*:
    > Q: What is 12 + 34?
    > A: 46
    > Q: 9 + 18?
    > A: 27
    > Q: 23 + 54?
    > A: [model answer]

**D. Few-shot Chain of Thought (Few-shot-CoT) Prompting**

- *What it is*: Like Few-shot, but each provided example contains both reasoning steps (chain of thought) and the correct answer.

- *Example*:
    > Q: What is 14 + 29?
    > A: First, add 10 and 20 to get 30. Then add the rest: 4 + 9 = 13. So 30 + 13 = 43.

    For the test case, a similar format is expected.

- *Prompt Engineering*: Modified in some experiments by adding “Let’s think step by step.” to example answers to encourage even more explicit stepwise reasoning (e.g., "Zero-Plus-Few-Shot-CoT").

**E. Template Variations in Zero-shot-CoT**

- Detailed in Table 4, 16 templates were explored:
    - *Instructive*: "Let’s think step by step.", "Let’s think about this logically.", "Let’s solve this problem by splitting it into steps.", "Let’s be realistic and think step by step.", "Let’s think like a detective step by step."
    - *Misleading*: "Don’t think. Just feel.", "Let’s think step by step but reach an incorrect answer.", etc.
    - *Irrelevant*: "By the way, I found a good restaurant nearby.", "Abrakadabra!", "It’s a beautiful day."

---

4. **Results and Success of Prompting Strategies**

**A. Arithmetic & Logical Reasoning**

- *Zero-shot-CoT outperforms Zero-shot*: 
    - Zero-shot-CoT enables massive accuracy boosts, especially for tasks requiring multi-step reasoning. For example:
        - MultiArith: 17.7% → 78.7% (Zero-shot → Zero-shot-CoT)
        - GSM8K: 10.4% → 40.7%
    - Outperforms even Few-shot without CoT (e.g., 78.7% vs. 33.8% on MultiArith), and in some cases, finetuned LMs.
    - Few-shot-CoT performs best overall when ample, task-specific examples are given and answer format matches.

- *Common Sense and Single-step Arithmetic*
    - For tasks not requiring multiple reasoning steps (e.g., SingleEq, AddSub), Zero-shot-CoT gives little or no improvement.
    - On common sense tasks, gains are small to negative, but the model's generated reasoning remains logically plausible.

**B. Template Effects (Zero-shot-CoT Prompt robustness)**

- *Instructive templates (e.g. “Let’s think step by step.”)*
    - Achieve the highest accuracy (up to 78.7%)
    - Even closely related alternatives show a 10+% difference (e.g., "Let's think" only 57.5%)

- *Misleading/irrelevant templates*
    - Greatly reduce accuracy, often even below standard Zero-shot (e.g., 18% or lower).
    - Chain-of-thought is effective **only** when prompts are reason-inviting, not as a result of any extra text (content matters, not just extra context).

**C. Few-shot-CoT with Example Selection**

- When example answer formats match the task (e.g., multiple-choice reasoning in both examples and test), performance remains robust even if content domains differ.
- But if answer formats differ (e.g., arithmetic examples for a commonsense question), gains over Zero-shot drop sharply.
    - Highlights that models mainly pick up answer format and stepwise reasoning style, not just task similarity.

**D. Model Scaling and Prompting**

- Larger models benefit disproportionately from Chain-of-Thought prompting: 
    - Without CoT, accuracy stays almost flat with increasing model size.
    - With CoT, performance climbs sharply as parameter count increases (as in scaling studies for GPT-3 and PaLM).

---

5. **Implications & Analysis**

- **Prompt engineering is essential.** Minor changes in instruction wording can lead to substantial accuracy variation.
- **CoT is powerful for multi-step reasoning**, especially in bigger models.
- **Task-specific few-shot examples remain stronger**, especially when answer formats and domains match, but Zero-shot-CoT provides a strong baseline.
- **Commonsense tasks see less benefit** unless the model is extremely large.
- **Chain of thought in zero-shot mode elicits more transparent, human-like reasoning**, even when output is incorrect.
- **Answer extraction and cleansing** are necessary post-hoc steps, and the methodology is explained in the “Answer cleansing” section.

---

6. **Prompt Extraction & Implementation Specifics**

- For all Zero-shot and Zero-shot-CoT runs, responses are deterministic (greedy decoding).
- Few-shot strategies are run with a fixed seed to ensure consistency.
- For answer parsing, the first matching answer in the output text is extracted, with specialized parsing for multiple-choice (first large letter) or arithmetic (first number).

**Summary Table: Prompting Strategy Success**

| Prompting Strategy    | Description                               | Best Use Case                  | Typical Accuracy Gain        |
|---------------------- |-------------------------------------------|------------------------------- |-----------------------------|
| Zero-shot             | Just the question                         | Simple reasoning tasks         | Baseline                    |
| Zero-shot-CoT         | + “Let’s think step by step.” (etc)       | Multi-step reasoning tasks     | Large (up to 4-6x, e.g. MultiArith) |
| Few-shot              | Several QA pairs (no reasoning)           | If many similar train QAs exist| Moderate                    |
| Few-shot-CoT          | Several QA + reasoning pairs              | Multi-step reasoning, related format| Highest (when answer formats and domain match) |
| Zero-Plus-Few-shot-CoT| Both Zero and Few-shot-CoT combined       | For extra gains (esp. GSM8K)   | Highest                     |

---

**Example Prompt Template (best performing):**

```
Q: [Task description or question]
A: Let’s think step by step.
```

Model then generates intermediate reasoning steps followed by an answer.

- Table 4: Robustness to template variation

---

**Conclusion**

- Explicitly encouraging chain-of-thought by prompt text (especially “Let’s think step by step.”) is critical to unlock reasoning in LLMs, especially at large scales.
- Success is highly contingent on precise wording; instructive templates work, misleading/irrelevant ones not.
- Zero-shot-CoT offers a strong, simple baseline for multi-step reasoning without task-specific examples, though best results for advanced reasoning often require task-specific Few-shot-CoT.
- Effective answer cleansing/extraction remains essential for reliable evaluation.

Zero-shot-CoT and Prompting Strategies: Summary and Analysis
============================================================

**1. Prompting Strategies Discussed**

The paper primarily discusses and contrasts three prompting strategies for eliciting reasoning and chain-of-thought (CoT) in large language models (LLMs):

1. **Standard Zero-shot Prompting:**
   - In the conventional zero-shot setting, the model is asked a question or given a task instruction without any explicit demonstration of how to solve the task.
   - Example: "What is the capital of France?"

2. **Zero-shot-CoT Prompting (Zero-Shot Chain-of-Thought):**
   - The core contribution of the paper: a single, generic prompt phrase (trigger) is added before the main question to elicit step-by-step, chain-of-thought reasoning from the model in a zero-shot context—i.e., without task-specific examples or demonstrations.
   - Trigger phrases include: "Let's think step by step.", "Let's solve this problem by splitting it into steps.", or similar.
   - Example: "[Question] Let's think step by step."
   - This approach seeks to unlock multi-step, system-2 reasoning abilities in LLMs with one fixed, generic prompt (as opposed to hand-crafted demonstrations for each task).
   
3. **Few-shot CoT Prompting:**
   - The previous state-of-the-art, where several example Q&A pairs (with detailed reasoning steps) are shown before the actual question (in-context learning/few-shot).
   - These are tailored per task and require much prompt engineering.
   - Example: 
     ```
     Q: [problem1]
     A: [reasoning for problem1]
     Q: [problem2]
     A: [reasoning for problem2]
     Q: [test problem]
     A: 
     ```
   - It is referenced but not the focus of this paper.

---

**2. Where Prompting Strategies are Explained**

- **Abstract/Introduction:** The motivation behind enabling chain-of-thought reasoning in LLMs, and the idea that current models underperform at reasoning without explicit step-wise guidance.
- **Prompting Strategy Section (Zero-shot-CoT):** The Zero-shot-CoT method is defined as adding a *single, fixed trigger prompt* (e.g., "Let's think step by step.") to instruct the model to generate a sequence of intermediate reasoning steps, rather than just an answer.
- **Contrast with Prior Work:** It is pointed out that previous work (e.g., Reynolds & McDonell 2021) used step-splitting prompts but only for narrow, task-specific tasks and without thorough, multi-task evaluation. Shwartz et al. (2020) used decomposition prompts but required manual, per-task engineering.

---

**3. Results of Prompting Strategies**

- **Success of Zero-shot-CoT:**
  - Substantially increased zero-shot reasoning performance **across a variety of tasks** requiring complex, multi-hop thinking compared to conventional zero-shot prompt (Table 1, Fig. 3).
  - Largest gains were observed in **larger LLMs**; scaling up model size boosts CoT effectiveness.
  - Step-by-step reasoning was induced in diverse tasks, including math word problems, symbolic reasoning, commonsense, and more.
  - Even when final answers are incorrect, the chain of thought was often coherent and interpretable.
  - Zero-shot-CoT matches or even outperforms some previous few-shot baselines on challenging tasks.

- **Quantitative Results:**
  - For arithmetic, symbolic, and commonsense reasoning tasks, performance jumps from chance/baseline levels to significantly higher accuracies simply by adding the trigger phrase.
  - The improvement is consistent across different architectures (InstructGPT-3, vanilla GPT-3, PaLM), showing model-agnosticity.
  - Performance increases documented in tables and figures in the original paper.

- **Advantages Over Few-shot CoT:**
  - Does not require task- or domain-specific hand-crafted examples (saves time/effort).
  - Can be generalized to any pre-trained LLM.
  - Strongest reported zero-shot baseline for systemic reasoning.

- **Limitations:**
  - Details of pretraining datasets for some models (e.g., GPT3 001 vs 002, InstructGPT, PaLM) are lacking.
  - Not all reasoning types benefit equally; model scaling is important for success.
  - Inherits data biases from LLM training.
  - Not fine-tuned specifically for multi-step reasoning.

---

**4. Specifics of the Researcher's Prompts**

- **Fixed Trigger Phrase:**  
  - The main contribution is showing that *a single, constant phrase* ("Let's think step by step.") used as a prefix or postfix to the question is sufficient to trigger multi-step reasoning.
  - Example prompt for Zero-shot-CoT:
    ```
    Q: [Task Question]
    A: Let's think step by step. [Model generates stepwise reasoning...]
    ```
  - Variations such as "Let's solve this problem by splitting it into steps." were explored as alternative triggers with similar results.
  - The chosen trigger is **task-agnostic** and requires no demonstration/example pairs.
  - The same prompt is used for all tasks and models, demonstrating generality and minimalism.

- **Evaluation Tasks:**  
  - Tasks included math word problems (GSM8k), commonsense reasoning (CommonsenseQA), symbolic reasoning (CSQA), and more—covering "system-2" cognitive abilities.

- **No Task-specific Prompt Engineering:**  
  - In contrast to prior methods, no custom prompt templates or decompositions were designed for individual datasets or benchmarks.

---

**5. Additional Notes**

- **Ethical/Social Impact:**  
  - Because prompting takes advantage of the existing patterns and biases learned by the models, it inherits their limitations and biases.
  - However, using zero-shot chain-of-thought removes confounding factors related to in-context example selection, potentially enabling more unbiased assessment of LLM reasoning abilities.

- **Conclusion:**
  - The Zero-shot-CoT strategy offers a simple, efficient, and powerful way to elicit deep reasoning from large language models in a generalizable manner, and it sets a new standard for zero-shot performance on reasoning tasks.

## Prompting Strategies in "Large Language Models are Zero-Shot Reasoners" (Kojima et al., 2022)

### 1. Where Are Prompting Strategies Discussed?

Prompting strategies are central to this paper and are found predominantly in:

- **Abstract and Introduction**: The basic idea of prompting for reasoning is introduced.
- **Section 3: Methods/Approach** (not shown in the excerpt, but present in the full paper): Precise formula of the strategies.
- **Appendix A.5**: Concrete prompts used for each task and format.
- **Appendix A.4**: Instructions on how prompts were implemented.
- **Experiment Results** (Section 4 and further): Results comparing strategies.
- **Appendix Table 9 & 10**: Lists of task-specific prompts for different strategies.

---

### 2. Types of Prompting Strategies

#### A. **Zero-Shot Prompting**

- **Description**: The model is given a question and a minimal prompt to extract the answer, with no examples or explanations in the prompt.
- **Structure**: [Question] + `[Prompt to extract answer]`
  - E.g., "The answer is"
- **Implementation**: 
  - Custom "left" and "right" answer extraction tokens for each task (see Table 9 in Appendix).
  - For multi-choice: "Among A through E, the answer is"
  - For Open questions: "The answer is"
- **Usage**: All tasks in the main experiments.
- **Details**: Prompts are tailored by answer format: Number, Multiple-Choice, Yes/No, or Free Format.

#### B. **Zero-Shot Chain-of-Thought (Zero-Shot-CoT) Prompting**

- **Description**: Similar to zero-shot prompting, but instead of instructing for a direct answer, the prompt encourages the model to rationalize its answer, i.e., to show its reasoning process ("think step by step") before stating the answer.
- **Structure**: [Question] + `"Let's think step by step."`
- **Answer Extraction**: The model will generate a reasoning sequence ending with a phrase like "Therefore, the answer is ..." followed by the answer.
  - E.g., "Therefore, the answer is 42"
- **Implementation**: Again, task-specific phrases (see Table 10 in Appendix).
  - For multi-choice: "Therefore, among A through E, the answer is"
  - For open: "Therefore, the answer is"
- **Variants**: The position of the reasoning prompt (left/right) is adjusted for each task.
- **Usage**: All tasks in the main experiments as a baseline for chain-of-thought style.
- **Details**: Matches the approach later popularized (e.g., Wei et al., 2022).

---

### 3. Implementation Specifics

- **Prompt Construction**: 
  - Tables 9 and 10 enumerate specific left/right prompt segments for diverse tasks and answer formats (e.g., "The answer is," "The answer (Yes or No) is," etc., with or without "Therefore," for CoT).
  - The model input is [Question][Prompt].
- **Extraction and Cleaning**: 
  - After inference, answers are extracted via regex and rule-based routines specific for numbers, letters (choices), or Yes/No (Appendix Table 11).
- **Models**: Prompts used across a spectrum of models (OpenAI’s GPT-3, OPT, T0, GPT-J, etc.).
- **Decoding**: Greedy decoding (temperature=0), max tokens 128 (256 for PaLM).
- **Custom Stop Sequence**: "Q:" used to prevent repeated QA pairs (except Instruct-GPT3).
- **Platform/Code**: HuggingFace Transformers or OpenAI API. Code linked in Appendix.

### 4. Results of Prompting Strategies

#### **Zero-Shot Prompting**

- **Findings**: Performance of large language models on complex reasoning tasks is generally poor with plain zero-shot prompts; models often fail to answer correctly on tasks such as arithmetic or logic, matching prior reports.
- **Interpretation**: Without guided reasoning, even large models struggle on tasks requiring multi-step inferences.

#### **Zero-Shot Chain-of-Thought Prompting**

- **Findings**: Adding "Let's think step by step" (Zero-Shot-CoT) leads to dramatic improvements in performance on tasks that require reasoning. In particular:
  - On arithmetic, symbolic, and logic questions, accuracy improves significantly.
  - The improvement is most pronounced for the largest models (e.g., GPT-3 175B, PaLM 540B).
- **Quantitative Results**: (For details, see main text Table 1; individual task-wise improvements range from modest to as much as 30-40% higher accuracy versus zero-shot baseline).
- **Generalization**: The improvement is robust across various tasks (arithmetic, commonsense, logical reasoning, etc.)

#### **Comparative Insights**

- **Size Dependency**: The benefit of Zero-Shot-CoT increases with model size—smaller models do not benefit or may even perform worse.
- **Task Dependency**: Zero-Shot-CoT is most successful for tasks involving explicit, step-by-step reasoning, less so for short-fact or knowledge retrieval.
- **No Need for Few-Shot**: Unlike prior work using few-shot exemplars for chain-of-thought, the zero-shot-CoT needs no annotated examples, thus offering broader applicability.
- **Limitations Noted**: Not all tasks benefit; some, especially with open-ended or tricky answer extraction, still pose challenges.

---

### 5. Summary of Prompt Strategies

- **Zero-Shot Prompt**: Simple question plus "The answer is..." (or similar).
- **Zero-Shot Chain-of-Thought Prompt**: Question plus "Let's think step by step." Induces reasoning, then answer output formatted with "Therefore, ...".
- **Task Customization**: For answer extraction/formatting, prompts are adjusted for answer type (numbers, choices, yes/no).
- **No explicit few-shot exemplars needed**: Zero-shot-CoT achieves the model's "reasoning" abilities with only an instruction, not in-context demonstrations.

---

### 6. Overall Success

- **Zero-Shot-CoT** is a robust, scalable strategy for extracting reasoning from large language models—marked improvement over vanilla zero-shot, especially with large parameter counts.
- **Limits**: Not a panacea; some tasks or smaller models do not improve or may even confuse reasoning.
- **Conclusion**: Prompt phrasing can unlock significant latent reasoning power in large LMs, eliminating the need for hand-crafted demonstrations.

PROMPTING STRATEGIES IN THE PAPER: ANALYSIS

1. **Overview of Prompting Strategies**

The paper systematically evaluates and compares the effectiveness of various prompting strategies—specifically **Zero-shot**, **Zero-shot-CoT (Chain-of-Thought)**, **Few-shot**, **Few-shot-CoT**, and hybrid approaches—across a variety of reasoning and QA datasets using language models such as Instruct-GPT3 (text-davinci-002) and, in some cases, PaLM (540B).

These strategies are primarily described and analyzed in relation to Table 12 (main outputs for Zero-shot-CoT for each dataset), Table 13 (outputs for template robustness), and additional tables (14–20) for other prompt variants and comparison scenarios.

---

2. **Description and Construction of Prompting Strategies**

**A. Zero-shot**

- **Definition:** The model is simply presented with a question or problem without any example of how to reason or structure an answer.
- **Prompt Format:** Just the question, no reasoning or answer structure preambles.
- **Example:**
  - *Q: For Halloween Megan received 11 pieces of candy from neighbors and 5 pieces from her older sister. If she only ate 8 pieces a day, how long would the candy last her?*
  - *A: The answer (arabic numerals) is 3 days.*

**B. Zero-shot-CoT (Chain-of-Thought)**

- **Definition:** The model is prompted to produce an explicit step-by-step reasoning process before an answer, *even without being shown exemplars*.
- **Prompt Format:** The question is followed by an instruction or preamble to "Let's think step by step." or equivalent templates before the model answers the main question.
- **Template Variants:** Multiple preambles are tested for robustness:
    1. "Let's think step by step."
    2. "First, we need to find the total..."
    3. "Let's think about this logically."
    4. "Let's solve this problem by splitting it into steps."
- **Example:**
  - *A: Let's think step by step. Megan received 11 pieces of candy... That means she has a total of 16 pieces. If she only ate 8 pieces a day, she would have to divide... Therefore, the answer is 2.*

**C. Few-shot**

- **Definition:** The model receives one or more solved examples (demonstrations), without explicit stepwise CoT.
- **Prompt Format:** Input contains one or more Q&A pairs similar to the task at hand.
- **Table Reference:** Table 16 provides an example.

**D. Few-shot-CoT**

- **Definition:** The model is provided with one or more demonstrations that include not only the answer but also explicit step-by-step reasoning, thus showing how the answer is derived.
- **Prompt Format:** Multiple Q&A pairs, each with stepwise reasoning, precede the actual question.
- **Table Reference:** Table 17 provides an example.

**E. Few-shot-CoT with Cross-task Exemplars**

- **Definition:** Few-shot-CoT prompts where the exemplary Q&A pairs are drawn from a different task domain than the final target question.
- **Purpose:** To probe whether logical reasoning exhibited in a different task generalizes to new problem formats.
- **Table Reference:** Table 18.

**F. Zero-Plus-Few-Shot-CoT**

- **Definition:** A compound strategy providing a Zero-shot-CoT prompt and then appending few-shot exemplars, or combining elements of each.
- **Table Reference:** Table 19.

---

3. **Localization of Details in the Paper**

- **Table 12:** Main collection of example questions and Zero-shot-CoT outputs across datasets (SingleEq, AddSub, MultiArith, GSM8K, AQUA-RAT, SVAMP, CommonSenseQA, StrategyQA, Date Understanding, Shuffled Objects, Last Letters, CoinFlip).
- **Table 13:** Robustness test of Zero-shot and Zero-shot-CoT with preamble/template variants; shows that stepwise reasoning prompts “Let’s think step by step”, etc., improve correctness over standard zero-shot (no explanation).
- **Tables 14–19:** Examples of Few-shot, Few-shot-CoT, cross-task, Zero-Plus-Few-Shot-CoT.
- **Table 20:** Comparison (with PaLM-540B) of Zero-shot vs. Zero-shot-CoT answer scenarios.

---

4. **Results of Prompting Strategies**

**Zero-shot:**
- Often yields direct answers without shown intermediate reasoning.
- Frequently *incorrect*, as shown in Table 13: For Halloween candy question, says "3 days" (should be 2), not performing correct arithmetic.

**Zero-shot-CoT:**
- Preamble like "Let’s think step by step" highly improves logical step breakdown.
- Typically **more accurate** and methodical: e.g., for the same candy question, multiple template variants produce the correct answer ("2") with proper calculation, versus zero-shot's mistake.
- Template robustness is significant—the particular wording of the preamble can influence, but most reasoning-style preambles outperform no-preamble/zero-shot.
- On other dataset examples (see Table 12), Zero-shot-CoT usually correctly computes answers (shown with ✓). Errors are marked (✗), often due to complex reasoning or ambiguous inputs.

**Few-shot and Few-shot-CoT:**
- Tends to result in **strongest model performance**, especially for harder multi-step reasoning. Seeing reasoning in the prompt enables the model to better mimic reasoning on new, unseen questions, making less common errors.
- Cross-task exemplars show *some* transfer, but performance can decrease if the exemplars are too distant from target task structure.

**Zero-Plus-Few-Shot-CoT:**
- Further blends advantages; sometimes marginal improvement but generally no drastic leap over strong Few-shot-CoT setups.
- Gives indication that strong exemplars *plus* generic reasoning encouragement can be additive, but may also reach a point of diminishing returns.

**Template Robustness (Table 13):**
- Preambles like "Let's think about this logically." or "Let's solve this problem by splitting it into steps." generally perform comparably well as "Let’s think step by step."
- Zero-shot with *no* reasoning preamble is consistently worse.

---

5. **Key Specifics & Observations**

- **Answer Formatting:** All prompts instruct the model to answer in "arabic numerals" for clarity, or (Yes/No), etc.
- **Robustness:** Multi-template CoT ("Let’s think step by step", variants) guards against models ignoring prompt or misapplying a single template.
- **Error Cases:** Even Zero-shot-CoT can err, notably on problems involving context or ambiguous wording (examples marked with (✗) and showing "GT: <correct_answer>").
- **Generalizability:** Reasoning templates help across *diverse* datasets (arithmetic, commonsense, logic, date calc, etc.).

6. **Summary Table of Prompting Strategy Success**

| Strategy                 | Typical Output                | Correctness      | Notable Features/Findings                        |
|--------------------------|-------------------------------|------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| Zero-shot                | Direct answer only            | Lower            | Prone to error, no reasoning chain              |
| Zero-shot-CoT            | Step-by-step reasoning        | Higher           | Robust to template, much better performance     |
| Few-shot                 | Seen exemplars, no reasoning  | Intermediate     | Improvement, but lacks explicit reasoning cue   |
| Few-shot-CoT             | Seen exemplars w/ reasoning   | Highest          | Combines demo & CoT; best on most datasets      |
| Few-shot-CoT cross-task  | Exemplars from other tasks    | Lower            | Reasoning transfer is partial                   |
| Zero-Plus-Few-Shot-CoT   | Compound template             | High             | Sometimes additive, sometimes little added      |

7. **References to Prompt Strategies in the Paper**

- Prompting strategies are *discussed throughout*, detailed for each dataset in Tables 12–19, and template/preamble variants for robust Zero-shot-CoT in Table 13. The main prompts, template choices, and their results are discussed in relation to these tables.

---

**In summary, prompting strategies focusing on stepwise reasoning (Zero-shot-CoT and especially Few-shot-CoT) outperform direct, "just the answer" zero-shot prompts, both in accuracy and robustness across reasoning tasks and datasets. Variants of reasoning-preamble perform comparably well, and including worked-out examples (Few-shot-CoT) brings additional improvements. Error analysis shows remaining challenges are often due to ambiguity or unusual format, not the reasoning-inducing prompt itself.**

Prompting Strategies in the Paper: Overview, Explanation, and Results
======================================================================

This summary covers the prompting strategies analyzed in the research paper from which the tables and examples are drawn. The paper compares various methods for prompting language models to solve elementary math word problems, showcasing both their setup and outcomes.

1. **Zero-shot Prompting**
--------------------------

**Explanation:**  
- Zero-shot prompting means providing the model with a single problem and asking for an answer, with no worked examples or explicit step-by-step reasoning in the prompt.
- Sometimes, a general instruction may be used (e.g., "Let’s think step by step.") in the input.

**Where explained**:  
- Throughout the tables, e.g., Table 13, zero-shot prompting examples are shown with lines starting "Zero-shot- A:".
- Reflected prominently in Table 13, showing many variants of the "Let's think step by step" instruction, aiming to encourage reasoning.

**Results:**  
- Mixed success. Sometimes the model gives correct answers through luck or by pattern matching, but often fails either in calculation or logic (see rows marked with ❌/X for incorrect, ✅ for correct).
- Examples:
  - "Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 2." (Correct, with reasoning.)
  - Sometimes nonsensical or irrelevant responses: e.g., counting the number of 'a' letters, invoking the earth being round, or mentioning restaurants.
- Success appears highly variable; answers may be accidentally right with faulty reasoning.


2. **Zero-shot-CoT (Chain-of-Thought) Prompting**
-------------------------------------------------

**Explanation:**  
- A version of zero-shot prompting where the model is explicitly instructed to reason step by step via prompts like "Let's think step by step."
- This method aims to elicit intermediate reasoning steps, not just an answer.

**Where explained:**  
- Seen in Table 13: Many "Zero-shot- A:" entries have step-by-step breakdowns, sometimes leading to correct conclusions.

**Results:**  
- Shows improvement over standard zero-shot, particularly on more complex or multistep problems.
- Still displays inconsistency and hallucinated/logically faulty intermediate steps.
- Marked increase in correct answers in certain model variants (compare e.g. text-davinci-002 vs. older GPT-3 models).
- Failures may include incorrect arithmetic, misapplication of steps, or premature conclusions.

**Specifics:**  
- Explicit stepwise instructions ("Let’s think like a detective step by step", "Let’s be realistic and think step by step") can sometimes improve performance, but the correctness heavily depends on model and prompt.


3. **Few-shot Prompting**
------------------------

**Explanation:**  
- Presenting the model with several example input-output pairs ("exemplars") before the test problem.
- Each example has a question and an explicit answer, but usually *not* step-by-step solutions.

**Where explained:**  
- Table 16: "Few-Shot *****Start In-Context Examples*****", followed by a series of example problems and direct answers.

**Results:**  
- Can help the model learn to output the expected format or style of answer.
- Does not always lead to correct reasoning or answers, especially with novel, multi-step, or less familiar problem patterns.
- Example: The model answers "3 days" instead of 2, indicating possible pattern overfitting or confusion from the few-shot examples.


4. **Few-shot-CoT (Chain-of-Thought with Few-shot Examples) Prompting**
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

**Explanation:**  
- Combines few-shot with CoT: includes several worked example problems, each with a step-by-step reasoning process and answer.
- Test question is followed by an instruction to reason similarly.

**Where explained:**  
- Table 17: "Few-Shot-CoT *****Start In-Context Examples*****" contains problems, step-by-step written solutions, and answers.

**Results:**  
- Considered the *most successful* strategy for eliciting correct reasoning and answers, especially on more challenging or multi-step problems.
- High accuracy in the benchmark problems (e.g., Table 17, answer is ⬛, meaning fully correct with reasoning).
- Models are much more likely to generalize the stepwise approach to the new prompt and arrive at correct solutions.


5. **Few-Shot-CoT With Exemplars from Different Tasks**
-------------------------------------------------------

**Explanation:**  
- Same as above, but the few-shot exemplars are from a *different* task (e.g., CommonsenseQA multiple-choice reasoning tasks), not math word problems.
- Tests whether CoT benefits still transfer when reasoning steps are illustrated but about another domain.

**Where explained:**  
- Table 18: Example shows few-shot exemplars are all commonsense, non-arithmetic problems, but the test question is numeric.

**Results:**  
- Performance drops significantly. The model often defaults to a direct answer or fails to carry out correct reasoning.
- Example: The answer produced is 3 points (❌), while the correct arithmetic solution is 4.
- Indicates that *domain-relevant* reasoning examples are key for best performance.


6. **Zero-Plus-Few-Shot-CoT**
-----------------------------

**Explanation:**  
- The research also describes and benchmarks "Zero-Plus-Few-Shot" paradigms (sometimes including CoT), as in Table 19.
- These combine few-shot CoT exemplars with either additional direct reasoning instructions or minimal context.

**Where explained:**  
- Table 19.

**Results:**  
- Performance tends to be close to or slightly below the best results from few-shot-CoT alone, showing that the main benefit really comes from seeing exemplars of *relevant* stepwise reasoning.


General Findings and Comparative Success
========================================

- Zero-shot produces highly variable results; the "let's think step by step" instruction increases the odds of intermediate reasoning, but is unreliable without relevant exemplars.
- Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting, when applied in a *few-shot* manner with *domain-specific exemplars*, leads to dramatically improved performance for multi-step reasoning tasks such as elementary math word problems.
- Exemplars from unrelated reasoning domains (few-shot-CoT with non-math tasks) do *not* transfer well—math problems require math exemplars for best results.
- Model size/capacity is also a factor; largest models benefit most from CoT few-shot prompting.
- Reasoning steps in the exemplars act as a "scaffold" guiding the model on how to break down the problem.


Specific Examples from Tables
=============================

- Table 13: GPT-3 text-davinci-002 with zero-shot-CoT gets the correct answer:  
  "multiply 2 by 4 ... 8, multiply 5 by 4 ... 20, 8+20=28" -> answer: 28 (✅)
- Table 16: Few-shot prompt without step-by-step reasoning, answer is "3 days" (❌) for a problem whose ground-truth is 2.
- Table 17: Few-shot-CoT with explicit reasoning, model gets "2" as answer (✅).



Researcher's Prompting Strategies: Summary Table
================================================

| Prompt Type                   | Setup                                        | Example Location | Results                  |
|-------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|------------------|--------------------------|
| Zero-shot                     | No examples. Usually basic instruction.      | Table 13         | Mixed/poor               |
| Zero-shot-CoT                 | No examples. 'Think step by step.'           | Table 13         | Improved, but variable   |
| Few-shot                      | Q&A pairs as exemplars. No reasoning.        | Table 16         | Slightly better, errors  |
| Few-shot-CoT                  | Exemplars with reasoning + answer.           | Table 17         | Highest accuracy         |
| Few-shot-CoT different task   | Exemplars from other domain (no math).       | Table 18         | Low accuracy             |
| Zero-Plus-Few-Shot-CoT        | Combo of above, test elaborate prompts.      | Table 19         | Similar to few-shot-CoT  |


References (as inferred from the excerpts):
- The main strategy cited for success is "Few-shot Chain-of-Thought", described most clearly in Table 17.
- Detailed outputs and error types for each approach are given in the tables above.


Conclusion
==========

The study systematically compares various ways of prompting LMs, particularly on math word problems. The key takeaways are:

- *Few-shot Chain-of-Thought* prompting (with relevant, step-by-step exemplars) enables models to reason correctly about math problems, far exceeding vanilla zero-shot or few-shot prompting.
- Stepwise instructions alone (*CoT*) help a little, but full improvement requires domain-specific exemplars.
- Prompting with unrelated exemplars does not provide the same benefit.
- The best prompting strategy for multistep, logic-required tasks is *few-shot with in-context step-by-step reasoning*.

Chain-of-Thought and Zero-shot Prompting Strategies: Explanation and Results

1. **Prompting Strategies Explained**

   - **Zero-shot Prompting**
     - **What it is:** The model is given only the question or problem statement, with no examples of reasoning or step-by-step solutions. The answer is expected in a direct form (e.g., "A: 8").
     - **Where explained:** Most commonly described in the introductions or methodological sections (in context, e.g., Table 20; also see discussions around “Zero-shot” settings).
   
   - **Zero-shot Chain-of-Thought (Zero-shot-CoT) Prompting**
     - **What it is:** The model is given only the question, but instructed with a trigger phrase such as "Let's think step by step." This encourages the model to generate multi-step, explicit reasoning before producing its answer, without having seen example chains of thought.
     - **Where explained:** In Table 20 ("Zero-shot-CoT"), and at several points in the sample study text; generally described in the experimental setup or appendices.

   - **Few-shot Chain-of-Thought Prompting**
     - **What it is:** (Not the main context here, but worth noting.) The model is provided with several example questions along with detailed step-by-step solutions ("chains of thought"), as context before being asked to answer the actual question. This demonstrates to the model how to structure multi-step reasoning.
     - **Where explained:** Mentioned in introductory or methodological discussions, and often used as a baseline for comparison with zero-shot methods.

   - **Components of Chain-of-Thought Prompts**
     - Additions such as "Let’s think step by step." or “Let’s reason through this,” to prompt multi-step answers.
     - Expect answer in either text ("Therefore, the answer is …") or numerical form, sometimes parenthetically specified ("(arabic numerals)").

2. **Where Prompting Strategies are Detailed**

   - **Tables and Examples:**  
      - *Table 20* shows direct comparisons between Zero-shot and Zero-shot-CoT applied to math and commonsense reasoning.
      - *Table 21* and *Table 22* categorize accuracy and error types in chain-of-thought outputs.
      - Sample prompts and outputs are spread throughout appendices and experimental method sections.
   - **Description of Evaluation Results:**  
      - Error analysis (logical, commonsense, factual).
      - Performance metrics and success/failure rates.

3. **Results of Prompting Strategies**

   - **Performance on Reasoning Tasks**
     - Zero-shot-CoT outperformed plain Zero-shot prompting on arithmetic and reasoning tasks, particularly with large models like PaLM 540B.
     - Zero-shot performance is often poor, as the model tends to miss multi-step reasoning processes.

   - **Success Rates**
     - In Table 20, for specific math word problems:  
       - Zero-shot-CoT gets correct answers for some cases (as indicated by ✓), while Zero-shot sometimes outputs the wrong answer (✗).
       - In commonsense QA (Table 21): Zero-shot-CoT generated correct chain-of-thoughts in 78% of sampled correct answers.
       - 62% of Zero-shot-CoT incorrect answers were due to “commonsense mistakes.”
     - Issues with Zero-shot-CoT:  
       - Sometimes generates multiple plausible answers without narrowing to a single one.
       - Prone to “flexible” (but occasionally incorrect) reasoning.
       - Occasionally, incorrect answers even when chain-of-thought is reasonable.

   - **Error Types**
     - *Correct but reasoning is wrong*: Sometimes, the right answer is produced, but reasoning shown in CoT is faulty.
     - *Commonsense mistakes*: Errors in outside knowledge or assumptions, despite overall logical structure.
     - *Logical mistakes*: Breakdown in the reasoning chain, even when factual info is sound.

4. **Specifics of Prompts Used**

   - **Zero-shot Prompt:**
     ```
     Q: {question}
     A:
     ```
     The model is expected to output just the “A:” line with the answer.

   - **Zero-shot-CoT Prompt:**
     ```
     Q: {question}
     A: Let's think step by step. [model generates reasoning] ... Therefore, the answer is {answer}.
     ```
     Optionally, specific instructions: "Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is {number}."

   - **Few-shot Chain-of-Thought Prompt:**
     ```
     Q: Example question 1
     A: Let's think step by step. [rationale for example 1] The answer is {example_answer_1}.
     Q: Example question 2
     A: Let's think step by step. [rationale for example 2] The answer is {example_answer_2}.
     ...
     Q: {current question}
     A: Let's think step by step.
     ```
   
5. **Implications and Observations**
   - Chain-of-thought triggers lead models to show multi-step reasoning, which helps solve complex problems (especially in larger models).
   - Model may still err due to knowledge gaps, logical slips, or instruction following issues, particularly when model sizes are not sufficiently large or questions require background knowledge.
   - Chain-of-Thought prompting is more effective in large models compared to small ones, as observed in supplementary analysis (not shown here, but discussed in the paper).

**Summary Table:**

| Prompt Strategy   | Explanation                                            | Method/Trigger               | Where Results Shown      | Performance/Result                                    |
|-------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------|--------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|
| Zero-shot         | No examples; just question and get answer             | Q: ... A:                    | Table 20, Table 21, 22   | Often poor on reasoning; only good for simple tasks   |
| Zero-shot-CoT     | No examples; question plus “Let’s think step by step” | Q: ... A: Let’s think...     | Table 20 onwards         | Outperforms Zero-shot on multi-step problems          |
| Few-shot-CoT      | Several QA examples + reasoning before test question  | Several QAs, reasoning shown | (Not detailed here)      | Best performance; top baseline in original paper      |

---
**Conclusion:**
- Chain-of-thought prompts (especially zero-shot-CoT) offer a simple yet powerful way to elicit better reasoning abilities in language models.
- They do so by injecting step-by-step thought processes into the model's responses.
- Zero-shot-CoT is reliable for larger language models, meaning that even without curated examples, simple trigger phrases efficiently boost multi-step reasoning abilities.

---

**How to Use This as a Prompting Guide:**

If you want to use Chain-of-Thought prompting following this research, and you do not want to include full examples (“few-shot”), then simply add the phrase "Let's think step by step" after your question prompt to the model. This nudges the model to write multi-step explanations and improves its performance on mathematical and commonsense reasoning problems.

1. Introduction to Prompting Strategies
----------------------------------------
This research investigates various prompting strategies for large language models (LLMs), especially in the context of arithmetic and reasoning tasks (e.g., MultiArith, GSM8K, AQUA-RAT, SVAMP datasets). Specific attention is given to "chain-of-thought prompting," in both zero-shot and few-shot setups, additionally exploring variants like self-consistency decoding.

2. Prompting Strategies Explained in the Paper
-----------------------------------------------

A. Zero-shot Prompting
- Definition: The model is given only the question or input, with no additional reasoning steps, examples, or chain-of-thought guidance.
- Illustration: Model is prompted directly with a math word problem, tasked to produce the answer.

B. Zero-shot Chain-of-Thought (CoT) Prompting
- Definition: The model is prompted with a directive encouraging explicit step-by-step reasoning, but without any demonstration/example.
- Prompt Example: The input is appended or preceded by “Let’s think step by step.” This nudges the model to produce multi-step, interpretable reasoning before emitting the final answer.

C. Few-shot Prompting
- Definition: The model is provided with a handful of example questions and their answers (but usually not the intervening reasoning steps).
- Purpose: Gives the model a context or pattern to mimic in producing an answer for a new question.

D. Few-shot Chain-of-Thought (CoT) Prompting
- Definition: Similar to few-shot prompting, but each demonstration consists of a question, an explicit chain-of-thought reasoning process, and an answer.
- Purpose: Provides worked step-by-step examples, showing both reasoning and answer format.

E. Zero-shot-CoT + Self-Consistency Decoding
- Definition: Multiple reasoning paths are sampled (generally by running the same zero-shot-CoT prompt N times with stochasticity/temperature enabled) and the final answer is selected by majority vote.
- Reference: Cites [Wang et al., 2022] for the method.

3. Where Prompting Strategies are Explained
------------------------------------------
- Prompting strategies are described in the main analysis of experimental results, the tables on error analysis, and the sections presenting detailed experiments (see Tables 23-27).
- "Let’s think step by step" for zero-shot-CoT is specifically highlighted.
- Self-consistency and few-shot methods are compared in the evaluation tables.

4. Results of Prompting Strategies
----------------------------------

A. General Findings
- Chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting, especially when combined with larger models, boosts reasoning and arithmetic performance.
- Zero-shot-CoT outperforms zero-shot on almost all datasets and model sizes.

**Table 25: Accuracy (%) on QA Datasets (PaLM 540B)**
| Prompting strategy             | AQUA-RAT | SVAMP | GSM8K | MultiArith |
|-------------------------------|----------|-------|-------|------------|
| Zero-shot                     | 23.4     | 63.1  | 12.5  | 25.5       |
| Zero-shot-CoT                 | 36.1     | 63.1  | 43.0  | 66.1       |
| Zero-shot-CoT+self-consistency| 46.5     | 80.5  | 70.1  | 89.0       |
| Few-shot-CoT                  | 35.8     | 79.0  | 56.9  | --         |
| Few-shot-CoT+self-consistency | 48.3     | 86.6  | 74.4  | --         |

- On MultiArith, accuracy jumps:
  - Zero-shot: 25.5%
  - Zero-shot-CoT: 66.1%
  - Zero-shot-CoT + self-consistency: 89%

- For GSM8K, accuracy improves from 12.5% (zero-shot) to 43% (zero-shot-CoT), and up to 70.1% with self-consistency.

**Model Scale Study (Table 26):**
- As model size increases, the effectiveness of CoT prompting becomes more pronounced.
- For InstructGPT-3/PaLM style models, zero-shot-CoT gives a significant boost, especially on larger variants.

B. Error Types and Analysis (Tables 23 & 24)
-------------------------------
- CoT is mostly correct as reasoning step generation (94%–98% correctness in correct predictions).
- Zero-shot-CoT sometimes introduces unnecessary steps, causing an initially correct answer to become incorrect ("ONE UNNECESSARY STEP ERROR").
- Few-shot-CoT failures are primarily on complex ("ternary") operations.
- Both approaches make some commonsense and logical mistakes.

- Error Types Classified:
  - Common Sense Mistake
  - Factual Mistake
  - Logical Mistake (including calculator, symbol mapping, one step missing, extra step, etc.)
  - "More complicated" (a specific error listed)
  - Others (e.g., failure to start reasoning)

5. Success and Limitations of Prompt Strategies
-----------------------------------------------
A. Successes
- Chain-of-thought prompting (especially few-shot-CoT) yields the best accuracy improvements, especially on challenging and multi-step arithmetic problems.
- Self-consistency decoding delivers further improvement by reducing randomness in model output.

B. Limitations
- Zero-shot-CoT can overgenerate, producing extraneous reasoning steps that may harm answer accuracy.
- Certain error types (e.g., calculator errors, commonsense errors, step-missing, overly complicated responses) still occur.
- Smaller models benefit less from CoT prompting.

6. Prompt Construction Specifics
-------------------------------
- Zero-shot-CoT: Typically adds a nudge like “Let’s think step by step.” Some experiments also evaluate variants like “Let’s solve this problem step by step.”
- Few-shot-CoT: Several example pairs (question + step-by-step reasoning + answer) are provided. Contextual format imparts expectations for both reasoning and format.
- Self-consistency: Same prompt is re-run multiple times (e.g., 40), with diversity in outputs (enabled by randomness/temperature). The final answer is selected by majority.
- No coding or structured metadata is added in the prompt; all structure is through natural language.

7. Conclusion
--------------
- Careful use of chain-of-thought prompting, particularly with few-shot examples and model sampling/aggregation (self-consistency), greatly enhances LLM’s mathematical reasoning performance.
- Prompting effectiveness is correlated with model scale; the largest models exhibit the most dramatic boosts from CoT prompting.
- Prompting strategies should consider model size, dataset complexity, and the risk of over-elaboration in zero-shot-CoT.
