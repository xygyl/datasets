# Prompting Strategies in "Detecting Code Smells using ChatGPT: Initial Insights"

## Where are Prompting Strategies Explained?

Prompting strategies are described primarily in:  
- **Section 2.2 Prompts Definition** (explains how prompts were conceived, their structure, and the process for creating them),  
- **Section 3 Research Questions** (explains the rationale behind comparing prompting strategies), and  
- Throughout the abstract/results, which discuss how the prompts affected model performance.

## What Were the Prompting Strategies?

Two distinct strategies were tested:

### 1. **Generic Prompt (Prompt #1)**
- **Description:**  
  This prompt does **not** specify the names or types of code smells being sought. Instead, it asks ChatGPT to analyze a given Java code block to see if "code smells" (or "bad smells") are present, but provides no guidance as to what types of smells should be found.
- **Purpose:**  
  To simulate a base scenario where ChatGPT must autonomously generalize and identify any bad smells, without context or examples of what counts as a "smell."
- **Format:**
  ```
  I need to check if the Java code below contains code smells (aka bad smells). Could you please identify which smells occur in the following code? However, do not describe the smells, just list them. Please start your answer with “YES I found bad smells” when you find any bad smell. Otherwise, start your answer with “NO, I did not find any bad smell”. When you start to list the detected bad smells, always put in your answer “the bad smells are:” amongst the text your answer and always separate it in this format: 1.Long method, 2.Feature envy...
  [Java source code with the smell]
  ```

### 2. **Detailed/Specific Prompt (Prompt #2)**
- **Description:**  
  The second prompt lists **exactly which code smells to look for**. Specifically, it tells ChatGPT to check for: Blob, Data Class, Feature Envy, and Long Method, which are the four targeted code smells in this study.
- **Purpose:**  
  To test whether giving explicit, direct instructions improves ChatGPT's code smell detection ability.
- **Format:**
  ```
  The list below presents common code smells (aka bad smells). I need to check if the Java code provided at the end of the input contains at least one of them.
  *Blob
  *DataClass
  *FeatureEnvy
  *LongMethod
  Could you please identify which smells occur in the following code? However, do not describe the smells, just list them.
  Please start your answer with “YES I found bad smells” when you find any bad smell. Otherwise, start your answer with “NO, I did not find any bad smell”.
  When you start to list the detected bad smells, always put in your answer “the bad smells are:” amongst the text your answer and always separate it in this format: 1.Long method, 2.Feature envy...
  [Java source code with the smell]
  ```

#### Development of Prompts
- Both prompts underwent several rounds of iterative refinement and pilot testing to ensure clarity and systematic output formatting.

## Specifics About the Prompt Engineering Process

- **Consistency:** Prompts were highly structured to enforce responses easily parsed and directly comparable. 
- **Typical Answer Template:** Answers must start with either “YES I found bad smells” and then a required phrase (“the bad smells are:”) followed by a numerated list, OR “NO, I did not find any bad smell”.
- **Format Validation:** The output was expected in a format suitable for automated parsing (some exceptions required manual validation, e.g. malformed outputs).

## Results of the Prompting Strategies

### Quantitative Results
- **F-measure (harmonic mean of precision and recall):**
  - **DataClass example:**  
    - Specific prompt (Prompt #2): F-measure = 0.59  
    - Generic prompt (Prompt #1): F-measure = 0.11

- **Overall Finding:**  
  - The **odds of ChatGPT providing a correct outcome with the specific prompt are 2.54 times higher compared to the generic prompt**.

- **Critical vs. Minor Severity:**  
  - ChatGPT was more effective at detecting *critical* severity smells (F-measure = 0.52) than *minor* (F-measure = 0.43).

### Statistical Comparison
- **Test Used:** McNemar’s test (a non-parametric test for paired nominal data) was used to compare the effectiveness of each prompt.
- **Metrics Calculated:**  
   - *Absolute Risk Difference*: The difference in proportions of correct identifications between prompts.
   - *Odds Ratio*: Quantifies how much more likely a correct answer is obtained using the specific prompt as compared to the generic prompt.

### Qualitative Insights
- **Improvement with Detail:**  
  - The more information the prompt contains about the smells of interest, the better ChatGPT performs.
- **Specific Guidance Matters:**  
  - ChatGPT’s ability to detect code smells is significantly improved when (a) the set of target smells is explicitly stated, and (b) instructions are constrained.

- **Format Robustness:**  
  In 27 out of 3,291 cases, ChatGPT’s response format deviated from expectations, requiring manual interpretation — but this was rare.

## Lessons and Next Steps

- **Prompt Engineering Value:**  
  Designing prompts that are specific and task-focused yields much better results with LLMs in code analysis scenarios.
- **Recommendations:**  
  - Enriching prompts with context (e.g., code dependencies), and (in later phases) possibly fine-tuning the model with code-specific datasets, could further raise performance.

---

**In summary:**  
The study tested two prompt strategies: a generic, open-ended prompt and a targeted, smell-enumerating prompt. The latter proved much more effective, more than doubling the odds of correct code smell detection, demonstrating that explicit, well-structured prompt engineering is critical for leveraging LLMs like ChatGPT in software engineering tasks.

**1. Where are prompting strategies explained in the paper?**

Prompting strategies are discussed in several sections:

- Summary of Research Questions (Section RQ.1, RQ.2, RQ.3, and RQ.4)
- Tables 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 compare the effect of different prompt styles (generic vs. detailed).
- Section 7.1 ("Potential Factors for Varied Performance") and Section 7.2 ("Integration of Contextual Information") contain further discussion and future strategies.
- Section 5 ("Threats to Validity") briefly considers limitations around prompt design.
- Related work and Discussion sections reference prompt engineering and its impact.

---

**2. What were the prompt strategies?**

The researchers investigated two main prompt strategies for using ChatGPT to detect code smells:

**Prompt #1: Generic Prompt**

- A general instruction to identify code smells, without specifying which smells to look for.
- Example (approximated based on paper): “Identify any code smells in the following Java class.”

**Prompt #2: Detailed Prompt**

- A more elaborate instruction, explicitly listing the specific types of code smells to search for (e.g., Blob, Data Class, Feature Envy, Long Method).
- Example (approximated): “Does the following Java class exhibit any of the following code smells: Blob, Data Class, Feature Envy, Long Method?”

**Table References:**
- Table 2: Results with Prompt #1 (generic)
- Table 3: Results with Prompt #2 (detailed)

---

**3. Results of the Prompting Strategies**

**Overall (Subsection: RQ.3 and Table 4):**

- The study conducted a McNemar's test (Table 4) comparing model correctness between Prompt #1 & Prompt #2.
- Results showed Prompt #2 significantly outperformed Prompt #1.
    - Odds Ratio: 2.54 (ChatGPT is 2.54 times more likely to provide a correct outcome with Prompt #2)
    - Absolute Risk Difference: 0.1641 (Prompt #2 yields a 16% higher chance of correct outcome)

**Prompt #1 (Generic) — Table 2:**
- Highest Precision: Data Class (0.52)
- Highest Recall: Long Method (0.92)
- Highest F-measure: Long Method (0.41)
- Blob was not detected at all (no correct identification)
- Other smells showed low performance:
    - Feature Envy (F-measure: 0.23)
    - Data Class (F-measure: 0.11)

**Prompt #2 (Detailed) — Table 3:**
- Blob: Some (low) performance achieved (F-measure: 0.19, previously undetected)
- Best improvement seen for Data Class:
    - Precision: 0.53 (+0.01 over Prompt #1)
    - Recall: 0.67 (+0.61)
    - F-measure: 0.59 (+0.48)
- For other smells, improvement was modest or negative:
    - Long Method F-measure improved only by +0.05 (to 0.46)
    - Feature Envy F-measure decreased by -0.02

**Severity Level Analysis (RQ.4, Table 5 & 6):**
- Performance by severity (Minor, Major, Critical) improves with Prompt #2 across all detected smells.
- Highest F-measures for Prompt #2 are seen for Critical Data Class (0.67), Critical Long Method (0.47), Major Data Class (0.64), and Major Long Method (0.47).
- Detailed prompt always outperformed or matched the generic prompt for severity analysis.

**Additional Discussion (Section 7):**
- The structure of the prompt was a key factor in detecting critical and major smells.
- Explicitly enumerating target smells (Prompt #2) made ChatGPT better at detecting them.
- Performance with Feature Envy remained low in both prompt strategies, possibly due to the complex/context-dependent nature of this smell.
- Data Class and Long Method detection, especially at higher severity, benefited the most from detailed prompts.

---

**4. Specifics and Insights on the Prompt Strategies**

- Prompt #1's generic nature resulted in lower detection rates. It did not guide ChatGPT to focus on particular code smell patterns, particularly failing with “Blob.”
- Prompt #2's detailed listing of code smells likely helped the LLM make more focused pattern matches, leading to large improvements in recall and F-measure, particularly for Data Class and critical/major severities.
- Detection of complex/context-dependent smells (Blob, Feature Envy) remains a challenge even with detailed prompts. The paper suggests that including even more context, structural code information, or step-by-step instructions (Chain of Thought) could further help.
- The paper discusses possible future improvements:
    - Task-specific prompts for each smell/severity
    - Stepwise “Chain of Thought” prompt design to scaffold model reasoning
    - Incorporating structural and contextual code information into prompts
    - Fine-tuning the model on code smell datasets

**Limitations:**
- Effectiveness of prompts might change for other programming languages or types of code smells.

---

**Summary Table**  
| Prompt Type | Description | Successes | Weaknesses | Key Results |
|-------------|-------------|-----------|------------|-------------|
| Generic (Prompt #1) | No specified smells; asks in general for code smells | Highest for Long Method, failed for Blob, low overall | Unable to find complex/contextual smells, low recall for Data Class | F-measure: max 0.41 (Long Method), Data Class F = 0.11, Blob undetected |
| Detailed (Prompt #2) | Enumerates specific smells (Blob, Data Class, Feature Envy, Long Method) | Major recall & F-measure improvements for Data Class, starts detecting Blob, better at Critical/Major severities | Still poor at complex smells (Feature Envy, Blob), gains not uniform for all smells | F-measure: up to 0.67 (Critical Data Class), Blob detected (F = 0.19), Odds Ratio 2.54 vs. #1 |

---

**Conclusion**

- **Prompt detail matters**: Explicit, enumerated prompts (Prompt #2) yield much better performance from ChatGPT, especially for easier-to-recognize code smells and higher-severity issues.
- **Complex/code-context-dependent smells** remain a challenge, suggesting future research should focus on prompts that include code structure, history, or reasoning scaffolds.
- **Statistically significant improvement**: Detailed prompts made ChatGPT ~2.5x more likely to return a correct answer.
- **Prompt engineering is crucial**: Designing prompts for LLMs is not trivial, and needs to be tailored to smell type, severity, and perhaps project/code context for best results.

Prompting Strategies in Large Language Models for Software Engineering Tasks
====================================================================

This document summarizes prompting strategies used in research leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) for software engineering, with focus on details from representative studies ([8], [11], [18]) from the provided bibliography. Included are the locations in the text where these are explained, the nature and specifics of the prompt engineering techniques, empirical results regarding their effectiveness, and details about their use/crafting.

----------------------------------------------------
1. Reference: [8] Pengfei Liu et al. (2021)
“Pre-Train, Prompt, and Predict: A Systematic Survey of Prompting Methods in NLP”
----------------------------------------------------

**Where Explained:**  
Sections 2 (Prompting for Pre-trained Language Models), 3 (Prompt Design), 5.2 (Prompt-based Applications).

**Prompting Strategies Discussed:**  
- **Manual Prompting:** Human-designed input sentences/templates to elicit desired behavior from LLMs.
- **Automatic Prompt Search:** Algorithms search for effective prompts (such as AutoPrompt, prompt tuning).
- **Prefix Tuning / Soft Prompts:** Learnable continuous embeddings as prompts, not interpretable as plain text.
- **Prompt Templates:** Use of fill-in-the-blank templates, e.g., “To fix the bug, the developer should [MASK].”

**Empirical Results:**  
- Prompting can significantly boost LLM performance on low-data and transfer scenarios.
- Prompting sometimes matches or exceeds fine-tuning when prompts are well-crafted.
- Automated prompt-search (AutoPrompt) outperforms many manual templates.

**Specifics:**  
- Example tasks: Code summarization, function naming, bug repair.
- LLMs often highly sensitive to prompt wording (“prompt engineering effect”); small changes in phrasing can yield large performance changes.
- Prompt tuning’s primary advantage is reducing need for large downstream labeled datasets.

---------------------------
2. Reference: [11] Jiho Shin et al. (2023)
“Prompt Engineering or Fine Tuning: An Empirical Assessment of LLMs in Automated Software Engineering Tasks”
---------------------------

**Where Explained:**  
Section 3 (“Prompting and Fine-tuning”), Section 4 (Benchmarks and Evaluation), Section 6 (Results and Discussion).

**Prompting Strategies Discussed:**  
- **Manual Prompt Engineering:** Design of task-specific prompts by humans (e.g., for code summarization, defect detection).
- **Prompt Patterns:** Comparing naïve prompts (“Summarize the following code: ...”) vs. more descriptive instructions or context-providing prompts.
- **Chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting:** (if applicable) Encouraging LLMs to “think step-by-step” to improve reasoning.

**Empirical Results:**  
- Manual prompt engineering yields significant performance improvements compared to zero-shot “default” prompting.
- Explicitly specifying input/output format in the prompt improves results.
- Fine-tuned models outperform prompt-engineered models for most tasks, but the gap narrows with expert prompt design.
- Prompting is more cost/time efficient for rapid prototyping and when training data is scarce.

**Specifics:**  
- Prompt design is iterative: researchers tried several candidate prompts, empirically evaluated their impact.
- Best-performing prompts often included: explicit task instruction, example I/O pairs, use of delimiters (`"""code here"""`).
- Code summarization prompts example:  
  “Summarize the following Java method in one sentence: \n [CODE]”
- Prompt success is measured via standard task metrics (e.g., BLEU, ROUGE for summarization).

------------------------------
3. Reference: [18] Jules White et al. (2023)
“ChatGPT Prompt Patterns for Improving Code Quality, Refactoring, Requirements Elicitation, and Software Design”
------------------------------

**Where Explained:**  
Section 3 (Prompt Patterns Framework), Appendix A (Prompt Patterns), Case Studies.

**Prompting Strategies Discussed:**  
- **Prompt Patterns Library:** Taxonomy of prompt “patterns” to guide developers (e.g., QA, summary, refactoring, example generation).
- **Role Specification:** Prompts that assign a role/voice to the LLM (“You are a senior software engineer...”).
- **Stepwise/Incremental Prompting:** Asking the LLM to work in multiple steps (e.g., “List issues, then suggest fixes”).
- **Explicit Context Setting:** Providing code context, constraints, or examples in the prompt.
- **Example Prompts:**
  - “Refactor the following method to improve readability and maintainability: [code]”
  - “List possible security vulnerabilities in this function: [code]”

**Empirical Results:**  
- Prompt patterns result in more consistent, higher quality responses than ad hoc prompts.
- Role-specification increases relevance and specificity of output.
- Stepwise prompts enable the LLM to break complex tasks into manageable steps.
- Research found that prompt libraries help standardize effective prompt construction.

**Specifics:**  
- Patterns are reusable and can be customized by users/developers.
- Authors advocate for using a pattern “catalog” to match prompts to user needs/tasks.
- Some patterns combine multiple strategies (e.g., role specification + multi-step).
- Examples show better performance in code review/refactoring/QA when using these patterns than without.
