**1. What is the point of this paper? What is it trying to explore? What makes it unique?**

**Point & Exploration**:  
The paper investigates how to improve software vulnerability detection using ChatGPT, a Large Language Model (LLM), specifically through systematic prompt engineering. The main aim is to see whether smarter, task-specific prompts can improve ChatGPT’s ability to detect vulnerabilities in source code compared to both basic prompts and conventional ML/DL approaches.

**What Makes It Unique:**  
- It’s the first to systematically examine the impact of different prompt designs, including the incorporation of auxiliary information (like data flow and API call sequences) — information traditionally used in DL models — directly into prompts for an LLM.
- The paper also explores "chain-of-thought" (CoT) prompting—multi-step prompting inspired by LLMs’ abilities to reason in several steps—on this task.
- It thoroughly compares prompt variants and analyzes strengths/weaknesses for two major programming languages (Java and C/C++).

**2. What dataset did they use?**

**Datasets:**
Two function-level vulnerability datasets:
- **Java Dataset:**  
  - Source: Software Assurance Reference Dataset (SARD), derived from NIST SAMATE project.
  - Contains 1,171 vulnerable and 917 non-vulnerable Java functions.
  - Only considers top-50 vulnerability types (CWE IDs) with sufficient sample size.

- **C/C++ Dataset:**  
  - Source: Collected from the National Vulnerability Database (NVD).
  - Contains 1,015 vulnerable and 922 non-vulnerable functions.

Both datasets were preprocessed to remove duplicates, explicit vulnerability hints, and overly short functions (<3 lines).

**3. What LLM models were used?**

- **Main Model:**  
  - OpenAI ChatGPT-4 (specifically referred to as "ChatGPT" throughout).
  - Earlier related works using ChatGPT are discussed, but all experiments in this paper are with GPT-4 (April 2023 version).

**4. What are the prompting strategies discussed in this paper?**

There are three major classes of prompt strategies:

1. **Basic Prompting:**  
   - A simple ask: "Is the following program buggy? Please answer Yes or No. [CODE]"  
   - Variant includes giving ChatGPT a “role”: "I want you to act as a vulnerability detection system..."

2. **Prompting with Auxiliary Information:**  
   - Prompts are enriched with explicit information:
     - API call sequences, extracted programmatically from code ASTs.
     - Data flow graphs (DFGs), showing value propagation among variables.
   - Example: "I want you to act as a vulnerability detection system. I will provide the code and [API/DATAFLOW information]… Is the following program buggy? [CODE]"

3. **Chain-of-Thought (CoT) Prompting:**  
   - A multi-step interaction:
     - Step 1: Ask the model to summarize or describe the intent of the code.
     - Step 2: Then use that summary/context to ask if the code is buggy, possibly adding auxiliary info here.
   - Inspired by LLM's ability to handle multi-step, reasoned problem solving.

**5. Where are the prompt strategies explained?**

- **Section 4:**  
  - Section 4.1: Basic Prompting  
  - Section 4.2: Prompting with Auxiliary Information (API sequences, dataflow)
  - Section 4.3: Chain-of-Thought Prompting
  - Auxiliary information extraction (API calls, DFGs) is explained in Section 3.3.

**6. What are the results of the prompting strategies, and how successful or not were they?**

**Summary of Results (from Table 2, Table 3, and text):**
- **ChatGPT significantly outperforms traditional baseline methods (like CFGNN and Bugram) on both Java and C/C++.**
- **Basic prompts**—with or without specifying a role—performed well on Java (accuracy 0.69 to 0.72). On C/C++, accurate for vulnerable code but poor at finding non-vulnerable samples, leading to class bias.
- **Adding auxiliary information** (API or dataflow) as part of the prompt:
    - **Java:** Adding API calls gives a notable boost (up to 0.75 accuracy in Pr-a-b) for non-vulnerable cases.
    - **C/C++:** Dataflow info can yield slight improvements, but gains are modest.
- **Chain-of-thought prompting:**
    - **C/C++:** Provides significant improvement (accuracy up to 0.74, highest among all settings)
    - **Java:** Did not improve accuracy, and sometimes worsened it.
- **Placement of auxiliary info in prompt**: Accuracy is higher when API call info is placed before the code and dataflow info after the code; effects are context- and language-specific.

**Successes:**
- LLMs, with proper prompting, can match or beat traditional methods.
- Auxiliary info, especially API calls for Java, enhances performance.
- CoT (multi-step) prompting helps more on C/C++ than Java.

**Failures/Limitations:**
- Strong class bias in basic prompting without countermeasures (e.g., keyword effect)
- Certain types of vulnerabilities (logic, context-light, comment-based) are challenging for ChatGPT regardless of prompt design.
- Not all auxiliary info or prompt orders help; some harm performance (overload? redundancy?).

**7. Why did one strategy give better results than another?**

- **Auxiliary Info**: Explicitly presenting API call sequences (for Java) helps because it summarizes semantic behaviors/functions that may be critical for vulnerability judgment—something ChatGPT fails to reconstruct automatically. Dataflow graphs help for C/C++ for similar reasons, as C/C++ vulnerabilities often hinge on subtle variable propagation.
- **Prompt Positioning**: Position matters—putting key information before the code directs the LLM’s attention effectively; the paper details experimental comparisons.
- **Chain-of-Thought**: LLMs are designed to perform multi-step reasoning, and CoT prompting exploits this, especially for languages/tasks less suited to shallow pattern matching (C/C++).

On the other hand, some prompts prompt the model to guess based on the presence of certain words ("buggy")—which introduces bias. Reverse-questioning tested and confirmed this.

Overall, prompts that are better aligned with how LLMs have learned to process information and make decisions (incorporating explicit information and structuring task context clearly) perform better.

**8. All specifics of the researcher's prompt strategies.**

Here is a breakdown of all the prompt strategies evaluated by the researchers:

**i. Basic Prompt (Pb):**  
- “Is the following program buggy? Please answer Yes or No. [CODE]”

**ii. Role-based Basic Prompt (Pr-b):**  
- “I want you to act as a vulnerability detection system. Is the following program buggy? Please answer Yes or No. [CODE]”

**iii. Reverse-role-based Prompt (Pr-r-b):**
- “I want you to act as a vulnerability detection system. Is the following program correct? Please answer Yes or No. [CODE]”
- Used to test for answer bias due to keywords ("buggy" vs. "correct").

**iv. Prompt with Auxiliary Info:**
- **With Dataflow (Pr-b-d):**  
  “I want you to act as a vulnerability detection system. I will provide you with the original program and the data flow information… [CODE]. [DFdescription]”

- **With API Calls (Pr-a-b):**
  - “I want you to act as a vulnerability detection system. I will provide you with the original program and the API call sequence… [APIdescription]. Is the following program buggy? [CODE]”

- **Position Variations:**
  - E.g.: Place [APIdescription] or [DFdescription] before [CODE] (Pr-a-b); after [CODE] (Pr-b-a), etc.
  - The study exhaustively evaluates different compositions (see Table 5).

**v. Chained (Chain-of-Thought) Prompts:**
1. **Step 1 (P(chain)_1):**  
   - “Please describe the intent of the given code. [CODE]”
2. **Step 2 (P(chain)_2,role):**
   - “I want you to act as a vulnerability detection system. Is the above program buggy? Only answer Yes or No. [Auxiliary info]”

   - Optionally, [APIdescription] and/or [DFdescription] can be provided here as well.

**vi. Prompt with Summary (P_s-b):**
- Conducted as an auxiliary evaluation: Code summary (generated by ChatGPT) is added to the prompt to see if explicit intent helps.

**Auxiliary Information Construction Details:**
- API call sequence and dataflow graph extraction are automated (described in Section 3.3)
- Each API call sequence is described: “The program first calls <A>, then calls <B>...” etc.
- Dataflow: “The data value of variable X at token Y comes from variable Z at token W..."

**Evaluation and Findings:**
- All prompts were tested on both Java and C/C++ datasets, and detailed ablation results are reported.
- The order and content of prompt fields (role, code, auxiliary info) were systematically analyzed for both their detection and explanation quality.

---

**In summary:**

The paper is an in-depth experimental study on how careful prompt engineering, leveraging both auxiliary technical information and multi-step reasoning, can unlock ChatGPT’s potential for software vulnerability detection at a level competitive with, or superior to, traditional ML/DL approaches, with nuanced findings regarding prompt structure and information content.
