### 1. What is the point of this paper? What is it trying to explore? What makes it unique?

**Point & Purpose:**
- The paper aims to *automatically identify the “vulnerable function”* (VF)—the exact function in open-source software where the root cause of a known vulnerability exists.
- This is important because most public vulnerability datasets (e.g., NVD) do not specify which function in code is vulnerable, which hampers precise vulnerability analysis and downstream security measures.

**What it explores:**
- It introduces **VFFinder**, a novel approach that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs), specifically with in-context learning (ICL), to extract key information from CVE descriptions and match them to functions in code.
- The method is focused on using only widely-available CVE descriptions and code, bypassing the need for hard-to-obtain (and often noisy) patches or PoCs.

**Uniqueness:**
- VFFinder is the *first approach to utilize LLMs (with ICL)* for the task of vulnerable function identification, extracting core “attack vector” and “root cause” entities from free-text vulnerability descriptions.
- It uses a custom demonstration selection mechanism (pattern embedding) to select relevant examples for ICL, improving extraction accuracy.
- The approach is language-agnostic and highly scalable compared to prior methods that rely on patch or PoC availability.

### 2. What dataset did they use?

The authors use **three datasets**:

- **A&R Dataset (DAR):** 642 CVEs with manually annotated attack vector and root cause entities from descriptions, used to test entity extraction effectiveness and serve as the ICL demonstration pool.
- **Vulnerable Function Dataset (DVF):** 77 CVEs over 75 open-source projects, each mapped to its ground-truth vulnerable function. This is used to evaluate the overall method.
- **Cross-project Vulnerability Dataset (DCV):** Used to assess practical impact by measuring false positive reduction in SCA tools.

The datasets combine public sources, past research (e.g., the Cross-Project Vulnerability Dataset [CPVD]), and extensive manual annotation.

### 3. What LLM models were used?

**Models:**
- The main LLM for prompt experimentation is **OpenAI’s ChatGPT (gpt-3.5-turbo-0613)**.
- For semantic similarity scoring (e.g. selecting demonstration examples and ranking functions), they use the **angle-llama-7b-nli-20231027** embedding model, based on Llama-2-7b-hf, trained for Semantic Textual Similarity.

### 4. What are the prompting strategies discussed in this paper?

**Prompting Strategies Compared:**
1. **No Demonstration (Direct):** Plain instruction plus CVE description.
2. **Semantic-ICL (S-ICL):** Few-shot ICL, with examples selected based on semantic similarity.
3. **Pattern-ICL (P-ICL):** Few-shot ICL, with examples selected based on a custom *pattern embedding* algorithm capturing the syntactic structure and key entity placement within descriptions. (The main and best strategy.)
4. **Baseline CaVAE:** Not a prompt, but an unsupervised classification NLP baseline for extracting entities from CVE descriptions.

### 5. Where are the prompt strategies explained?

- **Section 3.3 (Motivating Examples):** Discusses shortcomings in naive and unsupervised extraction, and the need for careful prompt design.
- **Section 4.1 (ICL-Enhanced Extractor):** Provides a detailed, step-by-step explanation of their prompting method—case pool construction, demonstration retrieval, and query/prompt template design. (See especially Figure 5 and related text.)
- **Table 1** (Evaluation): Shows results for CaVAE, Direct, S-ICL, P-ICL.

Example prompt template (from Figure 5):
```
Instruction:
I want you to act like an expert in vulnerability report analysis, I will give you a description. Your task is to extract the attack vector and root cause from it. Attack vector is the method of triggering the vulnerability. If you cannot find the corresponding answer, just answer None.

Demonstration Cases:
Description: ...
Answer: { "attack vector": "...", "root cause": "..." }
...
CVE Description: [query CVE here]
```

### 6. What are the results of the prompting strategies and how successful were they?

**Results (Table 1, summarized):**
- **Pattern-ICL (P-ICL):** Coverage 59%, JSI 0.58 —the best among all strategies; extracts attack vector and root cause most accurately with concise outputs.
- **Semantic-ICL (S-ICL):** Slightly worse (coverage 56%, JSI 0.54).
- **Direct (no examples):** Significantly less accurate (coverage 41%, JSI 0.35).
- **CaVAE:** Barely works (coverage 7%, JSI 0.04).

Using pattern-based demonstration selection in the prompt (**P-ICL**) gives substantially better extraction of relevant entities than semantic similarity or absence of demonstrations.

**Main Conclusion:** Prompting with syntactic/pattern analogies outperforms all other prompt types for this entity extraction task.

---

### 7. Why did one strategy give better results than another?

The **Pattern-ICL strategy outperforms others** because:
- CVE descriptions, while unstructured, often have recurring syntactic or structural *patterns* for key entities (e.g., “X is vulnerable to Y via Z attack;”).
- Pattern-ICL selects demonstration examples not just by word overlap but by similarity in the placement and role of entities, as encoded by their custom pattern embedding.
- LLMs perform better at extraction when provided examples (“shots”) that match the structure of the current test description, which helps the model learn to ignore irrelevant detail and spot the intended entity boundaries.

In contrast, semantic similarity may give superficially related but differently structured examples, and prompting without demonstrations leaves the model to generalize much more, leading to lower coverage and more noise.

### 8. All specifics of the researcher's prompt strategies.

**Detailed Prompt Strategy:**

#### - **Instruction:**
  - Tells the LLM to act as a vulnerability report expert and to extract “attack vector” and “root cause”.

#### - **Demonstration Selection (Case Retrieval):**
  - Uses a “case pool” of hundreds of manually labeled CVE descriptions, each with attack vector and root cause.
  - For any new CVE, selects the *Top-K* (usually 3) most structurally similar cases using their pattern embedding approach:
    - **Anchor entities:** Vendor, Product, Version (VPV), vulnerability type (VT), component, attacker—recognized via LLM rules or regex.
    - **Parsing tree construction:** Sentences are transformed into parse trees; irrelevant nodes pruned, then linearized to a sequence representing the template structure.
    - **Pattern embedding:** Each sequence passed through an autoencoder to get an embedding. The K nearest patterns are chosen for demonstration.
  - These demonstrations serve as “few-shot” in-context learning examples, maximizing their relevance to the current CVE’s format.

#### - **Prompt Assembly:**
  - Instructions + 3 closest-case examples + the new CVE description for extraction.
  - If ground-truth for current example exists in the pool, omit to avoid overfitting.

#### - **LLM Query / Output:**
  - The LLM extracts attack vector and root cause as a short JSON-style output.
  - If either cannot be confidently found, outputs “None” for that field.

#### - **Evaluation:**
  - The strategy is rigorously compared to alternatives (semantic K-nearest, no-shot, unsupervised), and shown to consistently yield the highest entity coverage and lowest redundancy.
