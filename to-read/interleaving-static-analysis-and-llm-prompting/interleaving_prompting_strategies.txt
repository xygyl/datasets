Prompting Strategies in “Interleaving Static Analysis and LLM Prompting”

Location: Section 4.1 – Building Prompts 

1. Common Context:
   - Includes a problem description and an explanation of the abstract domain used by the EESI static analyzer.
   - Contains domain knowledge: error codes, success codes, and error-only functions.
   - Lists observed idiomatic practices (e.g., valid error spec subsets, ⊥ for unknown specs, NULL=0, etc.).
   - Provides basic chain-of-thought examples with function definitions and their associated error specifications to guide parse-able output. 

2. Function Context:
   - For third-party functions (no source code), supplies the entire set of known error specifications as few-shot examples.
   - For in-project functions under analysis, supplies only the known error specifications of functions called within the target function. 

3. Question:
   - Presents the source code of the function being queried.
   - Asks the LLM to return any error specification it is confident in, using the provided abstract domain. 

4. Validation Strategy (Section 4.2.3):
   - Re-queries the LLM on every prompt to mitigate hallucinations and ensure consistency.
   - Instructs the LLM to verify that its output matches its own chain-of-thought reasoning.
   - Filters out any inferred specifications that include known success values or form improper supersets of the function’s return range.
